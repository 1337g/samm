## Governance
This business function contains the following three security practices.

### Strategy & Metrics

Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counterproductive. The goal of the Strategy & Metrics (SM) practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.

A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts. The practice works on building the plan, maintaining and disseminating it.

At the same time, you want to keep track of your security posture and program improvements. A metrics-driven approach is included to ensure an accurate view on your activities. To measure is to know.


#### Streams

  - `Create and Promote`:
    This stream is about creating and promoting an application security roadmap to set the objectives of the enterprise on this topic and increase alignment among stakeholders.
  - `Measure and Improve`:
    This stream aims to drive the validity, relevance, and improvement of the application security roadmap through measurements of performance within the organization.

### Policy & Compliance

The Policy & Compliance (PC) practice focuses on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.

A driving theme for improvement within this practice is describing organization’s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are met.

In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice entails an organization-wide understanding of both internal standards and external compliance drivers while also maintaining low-latency checkpoints with project teams to ensure no project is operating outside expectations without visibility.


#### Streams

  - `Policy & Standards`:
    This stream focuses on maintaining policies and standards and providing them to support integration into the SDLC.
  - `Compliance Management`:
    This stream focuses on identifying and providing compliance requirements to support integration into the SDLC.

### Education & Guidance

The Education & Guidance (EG) practice focuses on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams can proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization.

One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules. As an organization progresses, it builds a broad base of training starting with developers and moving to other roles, culminating with the addition of role-based training to ensure applicability and effectiveness.

In addition to training, this practice also requires the organization to make a significant investment in improving organizational culture to promote application security through collaboration between teams. Collaboration tools and increased transparency between technologies and tools support this approach to improve the security of the applications.


#### Streams

  - `Training and Awareness`:
    Training and awareness focuses on increasing the overall knowledge around software security anmong the different stakeholders within the organization.
  - `Organization and Culture`:
    Organization and culture focuses on promoting the culture of application security within the organization as an important success factor of an SDLC project.
