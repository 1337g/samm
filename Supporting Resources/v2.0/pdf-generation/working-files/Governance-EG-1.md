### Education & Guidance (EG1)

The goal of this practice level is to offer staff access to resources around the topics of secure development and deployment.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Train all stakeholders for awareness
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Basic security awareness for all relevant employees</i>

Conduct security awareness training for all roles currently involved in the management, development, testing, or auditing of the software. The goal is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks, security best practices, and secure software design principles. Develop training internally or procure it externally. Ideally, deliver training in person so participants can have discussions as a team, but Computer-Based Training (CBT) is also an option.

Course content should include a range of topics relevant to application security and privacy, while remaining accessible to a non-technical audience. Suitable concepts are secure design principles including Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability. Additionally, the training should include references to any organization-wide standards, policies, and procedures defined to improve application security. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities should be covered at a high level.

Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance. Consider incorporating innovative ways of delivery (such as gamification) to maximize its effectiveness and combat desensitization.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you require employees involved with application development to take SDLC training?

- No
- Yes, some of them
- Yes, at least half of them
- Yes, most or all of them


Quality Criteria:

- Training is repeatable, consistent, and available to anyone involved with software development lifecycle
- Training includes the latest OWASP Top 10 if appropriate and includes concepts such as Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability
- Training requires a sign-off or an acknowledgement from attendees
- You have updated the training in the last 12 months
- Training is required during employees' onboarding process


##### [Stream B] Identify security champions
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Basic embedding of security in the development organization</i>

Implement a program where each software development team has a member considered a “Security Champion” who is the liaison between Information Security and developers. Depending on the size and structure of the team the “Security Champion” may be a software developer, tester, or a product manager. The “Security Champion” has a set number of hours per week for Information Security related activities. They participate in periodic briefings to increase awareness and expertise in different security disciplines. “Security Champions” have additional training to help develop these roles as Software Security subject-matter experts. You may need to customize the way you create and support “Security Champions” for cultural reasons.

The goals of the position are to increase effectiveness and efficiency of application security and compliance and to strengthen the relationship between various teams and Information Security. To achieve these objectives, “Security Champions” assist with researching, verifying, and prioritizing security and compliance related software defects. They are involved in all Risk Assessments, Threat Assessments, and Architectural Reviews to help identify opportunities to remediate security defects by making the architecture of the application more resilient and reducing the attack threat surface.

In addition to assisting Information Security, “Security Champions” provide periodic reviews of all security-related issues for the project team so everyone is aware of the problems and any current and future remediation efforts. These reviews are leveraged to help brainstorm solutions to more complex problems by engaging the entire development team.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Have you identified a Security Champion for each development team?

- No
- Yes, for some teams
- Yes, for at least half of the teams
- Yes, for most or all of the teams


Quality Criteria:

- Security Champions receive appropriate training
- Application Security and Development teams receive periodic briefings from Security Champions on the overall status of security initiatives and fixes
- The Security Champion reviews the results of external testing before adding to the application backlog
