### Security Requirements (SR3)

The goal of this practice level is to mandate security requirements process for all software projects and third-party dependencies.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Develop a security requirements framework
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Efficient and effective handling of security requirements in your organization</i>

Setup a security requirements framework to help projects elicit an appropriate and complete requirements set for their project. This framework considers the different types of requirements and sources of requirements. It should be adapted to the organizational habits and culture, and provide effective methodology and guidance in the elicitation and formation of requirements.

The framework helps project teams increase the efficiency and effectiveness of requirements engineering. It can provide a categorisation of common requirements and a number of reusable requirements. Do remember that, while thoughtless copying is ineffective, the fact of having potential relevant requirements to reason about is often productive.

The framework also gives clear guidance on the quality of requirements and formalizes how to describe them. For user stories, for instance, concrete guidance can explain what to describe in the definition of done, definition of ready, story description, and acceptance criteria.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you use a standard requirements framework to streamline the elicitation of security requirements?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- A security requirements framework is available for project teams
- The framework is categorized by common requirements and standards-based requirements
- The framework gives clear guidance on the quality of requirements and how to describe them
- The framework is adaptable to specific business requirements


##### [Stream B] Align security methodology with suppliers
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Alignment of software development practices with suppliers to limit security risks</i>

The best way to minimize the risk of issues in software is to align maximally and integrate closely between the different parties. From a process perspective, this means using similar development paradigms and introducing regular milestones to ensure proper alignment and qualitative progress. From a tools perspective, this might mean using similar build, verification and deployment environments, and sharing other supporting tools (e.g. requirements, architecture tools, or code repositories).

In case suppliers cannot meet the objectives that you have set, implement compensating controls so that, overall, you meet your objectives. Execute extra activities (e.g., threat modelling before starting the actual implementation cycle) or implement extra tooling (e.g., 3rd party library analysis at solution intake). The more suppliers deviate from your requirements, the more work will be required to compensate.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Are vendors aligned with standard security controls and software development tools and processes that the organization utilizes?

- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, at least half of the time
- Yes, most or all of the time


Quality Criteria:

- The vendor has a secure SDLC that includes secure build, secure deployment, defect management, and incident management that align with those used in your organization
- You verify the solution meets quality and security objectives before every major release
- When standard verification processes are not available, you use compensating controls such as software composition analysis and independent penetration testing
