### Operational Management (OM3)

The goal of this practice level is to active Monitoring and Response

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Respond to data breaches
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Technically enforced compliance with your data protection policy</i>

Activities at this maturity level are focused on automating data protection, reducing your reliance on human effort to assess and manage compliance with policies. There is a focus on feedback mechanisms and proactive reviews, to identify and act on opportunities for process improvement.

Implement technical controls to enforce compliance with your Data Protection Policy, and put monitoring in place to detect attempted or actual violations. You may use a variety of available tools for data loss prevention, access control and tracking, or anomalous behavior detection.

Regularly audit compliance with established administrative controls, and closely monitor performance and operation of automated mechanisms, including backups and record deletions. Monitoring tools quickly detect and report failures in automation, permitting you to take timely corrective action.

Reviews and update the data catalog regularly, to maintain its accurate reflection of your data landscape. Regular reviews and updates of processes and procedures maintain their alignment with your policies and priorities.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly review and update the data catalog and your data protection policies and procedures?

- No
- Yes, we do it when requested
- Yes, we do it every few years
- Yes, we do it at least annually


Quality Criteria:

- You have automated monitoring to detect attempted or actual violations of the Data Protection Policy
- You have tools for data loss prevention, access control and tracking, or anomalous behavior detection
- You periodically audit the operation of automated mechanisms, including backups and record deletions


##### [Stream B] Review application lifecycle state regularly
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Full visibility into lifecycle of all software assets</i>

Regularly evaluate the lifecycle state and support status of every software asset and underlying infrastructure component, and estimate their end-of-life. Follow a well-defined process for actively mitigating security risks arising as assets/components approach their end-of-life. Regularly review and update your process, to reflect lessons learned.

Establish a product support plan, providing clear timelines for ending support on older product versions. Limit product versions in active use to only a small number (e.g., N.x.x and N-1.x.x only). Establish and publicize timelines for discontinuing support on prior versions, and proactively engage with customers and user groups to prevent disruption of service or support.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly evaluate the lifecycle state and support status of every software asset and underlying infrastructure component, and estimate their end of life?

- No
- Yes, for some of the assets
- Yes, for at least half of the assets
- Yes, for most or all of the assets


Quality Criteria:

- Your end of life management process is agreed upon
- You inform customers and user groups of product timelines to prevent disruption of service or support
- You review the process at least annually
