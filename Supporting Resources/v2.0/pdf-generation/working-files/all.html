<h2 id="what-is-owasp-samm">What is OWASP SAMM?</h2>
<p>SAMM stands for Software Assurance Maturity Model.</p>
<p>Our mission is to provide an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture. We want to raise awareness and educate organizations on how to design, develop, and deploy secure software through our self-assessment model. SAMM supports the complete software lifecycle and is technology and process agnostic. We built SAMM to be evolutive and risk-driven in nature, as there is no single recipe that works for all organizations.</p>
<p>The three main characteristics of SAMM are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurable: Defined maturity levels across security practices</li>
<li>Actionable: Clear pathways for improving maturity levels</li>
<li>Versatile: Technology, process, and organization agnostic</li>
</ul>
<p>The OWASP SAMM community is powered by security knowledgeable volunteers from businesses and educational organizations. The global community works to create freely-available articles, methodologies, documentation, tools, and technologies.</p>
<h2 id="the-owasp-samm-model">The OWASP SAMM Model</h2>
<p>SAMM is a prescriptive model, an open framework which is simple to use, fully defined, and measurable. The solution details are easy enough to follow even for non-security personnel. It helps organizations analyze their current software security practices, build a security program in defined iterations, show progressive improvements in secure practices, define, and measure security-related activities.</p>
<p>SAMM was defined with flexibility in mind so that small, medium, and large organizations using any style of development can customize and adopt it. It provides a means of knowing where your organization is on its journey towards software assurance and understanding what is recommended to move to the next level of maturity.</p>
<p>SAMM does not insist that all organizations achieve the maximum maturity level in every category. Each organization can determine the target maturity level for each Security Practice that is the best fit and adapt the templates provided for their specific needs.</p>
<h2 id="owasp-samm-structure">OWASP SAMM structure</h2>
<p><strong>At the highest level, SAMM defines five critical business functions.</strong> Each business function is a category of activities related to the nuts-and-bolts of software development, or stated another way, any organization involved with software development must fulfill each of these business functions to some degree.</p>
<p><strong>For each business function, SAMM defines three security practices.</strong> Each security practice is an area of security-related activities that build assurance for the related business function. There are fifteen security practices that are the independent silos for improvement that map to the five business functions of software development.</p>
<p><strong>For each security practice, SAMM defines three maturity levels as objectives.</strong> Each level within a security practice is characterized by a successively more sophisticated objective defined by specific activities, and more stringent success metrics than the previous level. Additionally, each security practice can be improved independently, though related activities can lead to optimizations</p>
<p><strong>For each security practice, SAMM defines two streams.</strong> Each stream has an objective to be reached, and this objective can be reached in increasing levels of maturity. Streams align and link the activities in the practice over the different maturity levels.</p>
<p>The structure and setup of the SAMM model support</p>
<ul>
<li>the assessment of the organization’s current software security posture</li>
<li>the definition of the organization’s target</li>
<li>the definition of an implementation roadmap to get there</li>
<li>prescriptive advice on how to implement particular activities</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overview-of-business-functions">Overview of Business Functions</h1>
<p>The SAMM model contains five business functions with three security practices each. This section provides a high level overview of each of the business functions.</p>
<h2 id="governance">Governance</h2>
<p><i>Governance focuses on the processes and activities related to how an organization manages overall software development activities. More specifically, this includes concerns that impact cross-functional groups involved in development, as well as business processes established at the organization level. </i></p>
<p><strong>Strategy &amp; Metrics</strong> This practice forms the basis of your secure software activities by building an overall plan.</p>
<p><strong>Policy &amp; Compliance</strong> This practice drives the adherence to internal and external standards and regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Education &amp; Guidance</strong> This practice focuses on increasing the knowledge in the organization regarding secure software.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><i>Design concerns the processes and activities related to how an organization defines goals and creates software within development projects. In general, this will include requirements gathering, high-level architecture specification and detailed design. </i></p>
<p><strong>Threat Assessment</strong> This practice focuses on identifying potential threats in applications.</p>
<p><strong>Security Requirements</strong> This practice focuses on defining appropriate security requirements for your software and your software suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>Security Architecture</strong> The security architecture practice focuses on managing architectural risks for the software solution.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p><i>Implementation is focused on the processes and activities related to how an organization builds and deploys software components and its related defects.</p>
<p>Activities within the Implementation function have the most impact on the daily life of developers. The joint goal is to ship reliably working software with minimum defects. </i></p>
<p><strong>Secure Build</strong> This practice focuses on creating a consistently repeatable build process and accounting for the security of application dependencies.</p>
<p><strong>Secure Deployment</strong> This practice focuses on increasing the security of software deployments to the production environment and the supporting secrets.</p>
<p><strong>Defect Management</strong> This practice focuses on managing security defects in software and their associated metrics.</p>
<h2 id="verification">Verification</h2>
<p><i>Verification focuses on the processes and activities related to how an organization checks and tests artifacts produced throughout software development. This typically includes quality assurance work such as testing, but it can also include other review and evaluation activities. </i></p>
<p><strong>Architecture Assessment</strong> This practice focuses on validating the security and compliance of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements-driven Testing</strong> This practice focuses on using both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).</p>
<p><strong>Security Testing</strong> This practice focuses on the detection and resolution of basic security issues through automation, allowing manual testing to focus on more complex attack vectors.</p>
<h2 id="operations">Operations</h2>
<p><i>The Operations Business Function encompasses those activities necessary to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained throughout the operational lifetime of an application and its associated data. Increased maturity with regard to this Business Function provides greater assurance that the organization is resilient in the face of operational disruptions, and responsive to changes in the operational landscape. </i></p>
<p><strong>Incident Management</strong> This practice addresses activities carried out improve the organization’s detection of, and response to, security incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Environment Management</strong> This practice describes proactive activities carried out to improve and maintain the security of the environments in which the organization’s applications operate.</p>
<p><strong>Operational Management</strong> This practice focuses on operational support activities required to maintain security throughout the product lifecycle.</p>
<h1 id="overview-of-the-security-practices">Overview of the Security Practices</h1>
<p>This section presents the fifteen security practices in more detail, in order to understand their objectives and the types of activities they contain.</p>
<h2 id="governance-1">Governance</h2>
<p>This business function contains the following three security practices.</p>
<h3 id="strategy-metrics">Strategy &amp; Metrics</h3>
<p>Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counterproductive. The goal of the Strategy &amp; Metrics (SM) practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization.</p>
<p>A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts. The practice works on building the plan, maintaining and disseminating it.</p>
<p>At the same time, you want to keep track of your security posture and program improvements. A metrics-driven approach is included to ensure an accurate view on your activities. To measure is to know.</p>
<h4 id="streams">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Create and Promote</code>: This stream is about creating and promoting an application security roadmap to set the objectives of the enterprise on this topic and increase alignment among stakeholders.</li>
<li><code>Measure and Improve</code>: This stream aims to drive the validity, relevance, and improvement of the application security roadmap through measurements of performance within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="policy-compliance">Policy &amp; Compliance</h3>
<p>The Policy &amp; Compliance (PC) practice focuses on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization.</p>
<p>A driving theme for improvement within this practice is describing organization’s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are met.</p>
<p>In a sophisticated form, provision of this practice entails an organization-wide understanding of both internal standards and external compliance drivers while also maintaining low-latency checkpoints with project teams to ensure no project is operating outside expectations without visibility.</p>
<h4 id="streams-1">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Policy &amp; Standards</code>: This stream focuses on maintaining policies and standards and providing them to support integration into the SDLC.</li>
<li><code>Compliance Management</code>: This stream focuses on identifying and providing compliance requirements to support integration into the SDLC.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="education-guidance">Education &amp; Guidance</h3>
<p>The Education &amp; Guidance (EG) practice focuses on arming personnel involved in the software lifecycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams can proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization.</p>
<p>One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules. As an organization progresses, it builds a broad base of training starting with developers and moving to other roles, culminating with the addition of role-based training to ensure applicability and effectiveness.</p>
<p>In addition to training, this practice also requires the organization to make a significant investment in improving organizational culture to promote application security through collaboration between teams. Collaboration tools and increased transparency between technologies and tools support this approach to improve the security of the applications.</p>
<h4 id="streams-2">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Training and Awareness</code>: Training and awareness focuses on increasing the overall knowledge around software security anmong the different stakeholders within the organization.</li>
<li><code>Organization and Culture</code>: Organization and culture focuses on promoting the culture of application security within the organization as an important success factor of an SDLC project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-1">Design</h2>
<p>This business function contains the following three security practices.</p>
<h3 id="threat-assessment">Threat Assessment</h3>
<p>The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on identifying and understanding of project-level risks based on the functionality of the software being developed and characteristics of the runtime environment. From details about threats and likely attacks against each project, the organization as a whole operates more effectively through better decisions about prioritization of initiatives for security. Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.</p>
<p>By starting with simple threat models and building application risk profiles, an organization improves over time. Ultimately, a sophisticated organization would maintain this information in a way that is tightly coupled to the compensating factors and pass-through risks from external entities. This provides greater breadth of understanding for potential downstream impacts from security issues while keeping a close watch on the organization’s current performance against known threats.</p>
<h4 id="streams-3">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Application Risk Profile</code>: An application risk profile helps to identify which applications can pose a serious threat to the organization if they were attacked or breached.</li>
<li><code>Threat Modeling</code>: Threat modeling is intended to help software development teams understand what risks exist in what is being built, what could go wrong, and how we the risks can be mitigated or remediated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-requirements">Security Requirements</h3>
<p>The Security Requirements (SR) practice focuses on security requirements that are important in the context of secure software. A first type deals with typical software-related requirements, to specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and data at the core of the application. A second type deals with requirements relative to supplier organizations that are part of the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development. It is important to streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development can have significant impact on the security of the application. The security of 3rd party (technical) libraries is part of the software supply chains stream (see Secure Build), and it is not included in this practice.</p>
<h4 id="streams-4">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Software Requirements</code>: Software requirements specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and data at the core of the application.</li>
<li><code>Supplier Security</code>: Supplier security deals with requirements that are relative to supplier organizations within the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-architecture">Security Architecture</h3>
<p>The Security Architecture (SA) practice focuses on the security linked to components and technology you deal with during the architectural design of your software. Secure Architecture Design looks at the selection and composition of components that form the foundation of your solution, focusing on its security properties. Technology management looks at the security of supporting technologies used during development, deployment and operations, such as development stacks and tooling, deployment tooling, and operating systems and tooling.</p>
<h4 id="streams-5">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Architecture Design</code>: The design of a software architecture can significantly impact the security posture of a software and the use of good security practices will improve the overall design.</li>
<li><code>Technology Management</code>: Technologies and frameworks are the cornerstones of any software solution. The security properties of these must be looked into to ensure an appropriate security level and to anticipate any potential issues herein.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementation-1">Implementation</h2>
<p>This business function contains the following three security practices.</p>
<h3 id="secure-build">Secure Build</h3>
<p>The Secure Build (SB) practice emphasises the importance of building software in a standardised, repeatable manner, and of doing so using secure components, including 3rd party software dependencies.</p>
<p>The first stream focuses on removing any subjectivity from the build process by striving for full automation. An automated build pipeline can include additional automated security checks such as SAST and DAST to gain further assurance and flag security regressions early by failing the build, for example.</p>
<p>The second stream acknowledges the prevalence of software dependencies in modern applications. It aims to identify them and track their security status in order to contain the impact of their insecurity on an otherwise secure application. In an advanced form, it applies similar security checks to software dependencies as to the application itself.</p>
<h4 id="streams-6">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Build Process</code>: A consistent build process ensures the software you are deploying is predictable and directly linked to the source code. Furthermore, you can take advantage of the software build process for various security activities.</li>
<li><code>Software Dependencies</code>: External libraries are a significant part of modern software. The activities in this stream help create a view of external libraries and ensure their security strength is adequate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="secure-deployment">Secure Deployment</h3>
<p>One of the final stages in delivering secure software is ensuring the security and integrity of developed applications are not compromised during deployment. The Secure Deployment (SD) practice focuses on this. To this end, the practice’s first stream focuses on removing manual error by automating the deployment process as much as possible, and making its success contingent upon the outcomes of integrated security verification checks. It also fosters Separation of Duties by making adequately trained, non-developers responsible for deployment.</p>
<p>The second stream goes beyond the mechanics of deployment, and focuses on protecting the privacy and integrity of sensitive data, such as passwords, tokens, and other secrets, required for applications to operate in production environments. In its simplest form, suitable production secrets are moved from repositories and configuration files into adequately managed digital vaults. In more advanced forms, secrets are dynamically generated at deployment time and routine processes detect and mitigate the presence of any unprotected secrets in the environment.</p>
<h4 id="streams-7">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Deployment Process</code>: A repeatable and consistent deployment process ensures you only deploy correct software artifacts to production. It also paves the way for representative test environments prior to production.</li>
<li><code>Secret Management</code>: As the secure execution of any software system requires credentials, this stream ensures a proper handling of these sensitive data elements within the organization’s environment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="defect-management">Defect Management</h3>
<p>The Defect Management (DM) practice focuses on collecting, recording, and analyzing software security defects and enriching them with information to drive metrics-based decisions.</p>
<p>The practice’s first stream deals with the process of handling and managing defects to ensure released software has a given assurance level. The second stream focuses on enriching the information about the defects and deriving metrics to guide decisions about the security of individual projects and of the security assurance program as a whole.</p>
<p>In a sophisticated form, the practice requires formalised, independent defect management and real-time, correlated information to detect trends and influence security strategy.</p>
<h4 id="streams-8">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>Defect Tracking</code>: Defect tracking manages the collection and follow-up of all potential issues in a piece of software, from architectural flaws to coding issues and run-time vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Metrics and Feedback</code>: Defect tracking can drive the improvement of security activities within the organization through metrics and feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="verification-1">Verification</h2>
<p>This business function contains the following three security practices.</p>
<h3 id="architecture-assessment">Architecture Assessment</h3>
<p>The Architecture Assessment (AA) practice ensures that the application and infrastructure architecture adequately meets all relevant security and compliance requirements, and sufficiently mitigates identified security threats. The first stream focuses on verifying that the security and compliance requirements identified in the Policy &amp; Compliance and Security Requirements practices are met, first in an ad-hoc manner, then more systematically for each interface in the system. The second stream reviews the architecture, first for mitigations against typical threats, then against the specific threats identified in the Threat Assessment practice.</p>
<p>In its more advanced form, the practice formalizes the security architecture review process, continuously evaluates the effectiveness of the architecture’s security controls, their scalability and strategic alignment. Identified weaknesses and possible improvements are fed back to the Security Architecture practice to improve reference architectures.</p>
<h4 id="streams-9">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Architecture Validation</code>: Architecture validation confirms the security of the software and supporting architecture by identifying application and infrastructure architecture components and verifying their provision of security objectives and requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Architecture Mitigation</code>: Architecture mitigation focuses on ensuring that all threats identified during Threat Assessment are adequately mitigated, and existing reference architectures updated to address any unhandled threats.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="requirements-driven-testing">Requirements-driven Testing</h3>
<p>The goal of the Requirements-driven Testing (RT) practice is to ensure that the implemented security controls operate as expected and satisfy the project’s stated security requirements. It does so by incrementally building a set of security test and regression cases and executing them regularly.</p>
<p>A key aspect of this practice is its attention to both positive and negative testing. The former verifies that the application’s security controls satisfy stated security requirements and validates their correct functioning. These requirements are typically functional in nature. Negative testing addresses the quality of the implementation of the security controls and aims to detect unexpected design flaws and implementation bugs through misuse and abuse testing. In its more advanced forms, the practice promotes security stress testing, such as denial of service, and strives to continuously improve application security by consistently automating security unit tests and creating security regression tests for all bugs identified and fixed.</p>
<p>Although both the Requirements-driven Testing and Security Testing practices are concerned with security testing, the former focuses on verifying the correct implementation of security requirements, while the latter aims to uncover technical implementation weaknesses in an application, irrespective of requirements.</p>
<h4 id="streams-10">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Control Verification</code>: Control Verification validates that security controls and requirements are met through testing derived from requirements, and prevents the introduction of bugs into later releases through regression testing.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Misuse/Abuse Testing</code>: Misuse/Abuse Testing leverages fuzzing, misuse/abuse cases, and the identification of any functionality or resources in the software that can be abused in order to identify weaknesses in features to attack an application.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="security-testing">Security Testing</h3>
<p>The Security Testing (ST) practice leverages the fact that, while automated security testing is fast and scales well to numerous applications, in-depth testing based on good knowledge of an application and its business logic is often only possible via slower, manual expert security testing. Each stream therefore has one approach at its core.</p>
<p>The first stream focuses on establishing a common security baseline to automatically detect so-called “low hanging fruit”. Progressively customize the automated tests for each application and increase their frequency of execution to detect more bugs and regressions earlier, as close as possible to their inception. The more bugs the automated processes can detect, the more time experts have to use their knowledge and creativity to focus on more complex attack vectors and ensure in-depth application testing in the second stream. As manual review is slow and hard to scale, reviewers prioritize testing components based on their risk, recent relevant changes, or upcoming major releases. Organizations can also access external expertise by participating in bug bounty programs, for example.</p>
<p>Unlike the Requirements-driven testing practice which focuses on verifying that applications correctly implement their requirements, the goal of this practice is to uncover technical and business-logic weaknesses in application and make them visible to management and business stakeholders, irrespective of requirements.</p>
<h4 id="streams-11">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Scalable Baseline</code>: Scalable baseline focuses on the use of application-specific automated testing tools that integrate security validation into the build and deploy process. The goal of this stream is to favor width (a broad spectrum of applications) over depth of testing.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Deep Understanding</code>: Deep understanding focuses on performing manual security testing of high-risk components, using complex attack vectors with the goal of making advanced security testing an integral part of the development process. The goal of this stream is to favor testing depth (testing rigour) over testing width (the portfolio of applications).</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operations-1">Operations</h2>
<p>This business function contains the following three security practices.</p>
<h3 id="incident-management">Incident Management</h3>
<p>Once your organization has applications in operation, you’re likely to face security incidents. In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset’s security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code. The Incident Management (IM) practice focuses on dealing with these in your organization.</p>
<p>Historically, many security incidents have been detected months, or even years, after the initial breach. During the “dwell time” before an incident is detected, significant damage can occur, increasing the difficulty of recovery. Our first activity stream, Incident Detection, focuses on decreasing that dwell time.</p>
<p>Once you have identified that you’re suffering from a security incident, it’s essential to respond in a disciplined, thorough manner to limit the damage, and return to normal operations as efficiently as possible. This is the focus of our second stream.</p>
<h4 id="streams-12">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Incident Detection</code>: Incident Detection refers to the process of determining an identified security-relevant event is, in fact, a security incident. The activities in this stream focus on the organization’s ability to identify security incidents when they occur, and to initiate appropriate incident response activities.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Incident Response</code>: Incident Response starts the moment you acknowledge and verify the existence of a security incident. Your goal is to act in a coordinated and efficient way so that further damage is limited as much as possible. The activities in this stream focus on the organization’s ability to respond appropriately and effectively to reported security incidents.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="environment-management">Environment Management</h3>
<p>The organization’s work on application security doesn’t end once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you’re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.</p>
<p>Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default. This is frequently intentional, to enhance backwards compatibility or ease of setup. For this reason, ensuring the secure operation of the organization’s technology stack requires the consistent application of secure baseline configurations to all components. The Environment Management (EM) practice focuses on keeping your environment clean and secure.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities are discovered throughout the lifecycles of the technologies on which your organization relies, and new versions addressing them are released on various schedules. This makes it essential to monitor vulnerability reports and perform orderly, timely patching across all affected systems.</p>
<h4 id="streams-13">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Configuration Hardening</code>: The activities in this stream focus on the organization’s management of security-related configurations in all elements of the technology stack. The emphasis is on those elements (e.g., operating systems, containers, frameworks, services, appliances, and libraries) obtained from third parties, because their architecture and design are not under the organization’s control.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Patching and Updating</code>: The activities in this stream focus on the organization’s handling of patches and updates for all elements of the technology stack. For software developed by the organization, these activities are concerned with delivering patches and updates to customers, as well as applying them to organization-managed solutions (e.g., software as a service). For third-party elements, these activities are concerned with the organization’s timely application of updates and patches received.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operational-management">Operational Management</h3>
<p>The Operational Management (OM) practice focuses on activities to ensure security is maintained throughout operational support functions. Although these functions are not performed directly by an application, the overall security of the application and its data depends on their proper performance. Deploying an application on an unsupported operating system with unpatched vulnerabilities, or failing to store backup media securely, can make the protections built into that application irrelevant.</p>
<p>The functions covered by this practice include, but are not limited to: system provisioning, administration, and decommissioning; database provisioning and administration; and data backup, restore, and archival.</p>
<h4 id="streams-14">Streams</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Data Protection</code>: The activities in this stream focus on ensuring the organization properly protects data in all aspects of their creation, handling, storage, and processing.</p></li>
<li><p><code>System Decomissioning / Legacy Management</code>: From the perspective of the organization as a consumer of resources, the activities in this stream focus on the identification, management, and tracking of systems, applications, application dependencies, and services that are no longer used, have reached end of life, or are no longer actively developed or supported. Removal of unused systems and services improves manageability of the environment and reduces the organization’s attack surface, while affording direct and indirect cost savings (e.g., reduced license count, reduced logging volume, or reduced analyst effort).</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overview-of-security-activities">Overview of Security Activities</h1>
<p>This section provides further details at the level of individual activities. Per activity, we discuss the benefit, provide a more detailed description, assessment questions and linked quality criteria.</p>
<h2 id="governance-2">Governance</h2>
<div class="new-page"/>
<h3 id="strategy-metrics-sm1">Strategy &amp; Metrics (SM1)</h3>
<p>The goal of this practice level is to identify objectives and means of measuring effectiveness of the security program.</p>
<h4 id="activities">Activities</h4>
<h5 id="stream-a-identify-the-organizations-risk-appetite">[Stream A] Identify the organization’s risk appetite</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Common understanding of your organization’s security posture</i></p>
<p>Understand, based on application risk exposure, what threats exist or may exist, as well as how tolerant executive leadership is of these risks. This understanding is a key component of determining software security assurance priorities. To ascertain these threats, interview business owners and stakeholders and document drivers specific to industries where the organization operates as well as drivers specific to the organization. Gathered information includes worst-case scenarios that could impact the organization, as well as opportunities where an optimized software development lifecycle and more secure applications could provide a market-differentiator or create additional opportunities.</p>
<p>Gathered information provides a baseline for the organization to develop and promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the organization’s priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if they are compromised.</p>
<p>The baseline and individual risk factors should be published and made available to application development teams to ensure a more transparent process of creating application risk profiles and incorporating the organization’s priorities into the program. Additionally, these goals should provide a set of objectives which should be used to ensure all application security program enhancements provide direct support of the organization’s current and future needs.</p>
<h6 id="assessment-questions">Assessment Question(s)</h6>
<p>Do you understand the enterprise-wide risk appetite for your applications ?</p>
<ul>
<li>No</li>
<li>Yes, it covers general risks</li>
<li>Yes, it covers organization-specific risks</li>
<li>Yes, it covers risks and opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Quality Criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>You capture the risk appetite of your organization’s executive leadership</li>
<li>The organization’s leadership vet and approve the set of risks</li>
<li>You identify the main business and technical threats to your assets and data</li>
<li>You document risks and store them in an accessible location</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="stream-b-define-basic-security-metrics">[Stream B] Define basic security metrics</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Basic insights into your AppSec program’s effectiveness and efficiency</i></p>
<p>Define and document metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security program. This way improvements are measurable and you can use them to secure future support and funding for the program. Considering the dynamic nature of most development environments, metrics should be comprised of measurements in the following categories</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Effort</code> metrics measure the effort spent on security. For example training hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications scanned for vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Result</code> metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include number of unpatched security defects and number of security incidents involving application vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><code>Environment</code> metrics measure the environment where security efforts take place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure of difficulty or complexity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each measure by itself is useful for a specific purpose, but a combination of two or three metrics together helps explain spikes in metrics trends. For example, a spike in a total number of vulnerabilities may be caused by the organization on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security program.</p>
<p>While identifying metrics, it’s always recommended to stick to the metrics that meet several criteria</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistently Measured</li>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Clear expectation of minimum security level in the organization</i></p>
<p>Develop a library of policies and standards to govern all aspects of software development in the organization. Policies and standards are based on existing industry standards and appropriate for the organization’s industry. Due to the full range of technology-specific limitations and best practices, review proposed standards with the various product teams. With the overarching objective of increasing security of the applications and computing infrastructure, invite product teams to offer feedback on any aspects of the standards that would not be feasible or cost-effective to implement, as well as opportunities for standards to go further with little effort on the product teams.</p>
<p>For policies, emphasize high-level definitions and aspects of application security that do not depend on specific technology or hosting environment. Focus on broader objectives of the organization to protect the integrity of its computing environment, safety and privacy of the data, and maturity of the software development life-cycles. For larger organizations, policies may qualify specific requirements based on data classification or application functionality, but should not be detailed enough to offer technology-specific guidance.</p>
<p>For standards, incorporate requirements set forth by policies, and focus on technology-specific implementation guidance intended to capture and take advantage of the security features of different programming languages and frameworks. Standards require input from senior developers and architects considered experts in various technologies in use by the organization. Create them in a format that allows for periodic updates. Label or tag individual requirements with the policy or a 3rd party requirement, to make maintenance and audits easier and more efficient.</p>
<h6 id="assessment-questions-6">Assessment Question(s)</h6>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Security policies and standards aligned with external compliance drivers</i></p>
<p>Create a comprehensive list of all compliance requirements, including any triggers that could help determine which applications are in scope. Compliance requirements may be considered in scope based on factors such as geographic location, types of data, or contractual obligations with clients or business partners. Review each identified compliance requirement with the appropriate experts and legal, to ensure the obligation is understood. Since many compliance obligations vary in applicability based on how the data is processed, stored, or transmitted across the computing environment, compliance drivers should always indicate opportunities for lowering the overall compliance burden by changing how the data is handled.</p>
<p>Evaluate publishing a compliance matrix to help identify which factors could put an application in scope for a specific regulatory requirement. Have the matrix indicate which compliance requirements are applicable at the organization level and do not depend on individual applications. The matrix provides at least a basic understanding of useful compliance requirements to review obligations around different applications.</p>
<p>Since many compliance standards are focused around security best-practices, many compliance requirements may already be a part of the Policy and Standards library published by the organization. Therefore, once you review compliance requirements, map them to any applicable existing policies and standards. Whenever there are discrepancies, update the policies and standards to include organization-wide compliance requirements. Then, begin creating compliance-specific standards only applicable to individual compliance requirements. The goal is to have a compliance matrix that indicates which policies and standards have more detailed information about compliance requirements, as well as ensure individual policies and standards reference applicable compliance requirements.</p>

The library is available to all application development teams. It includes guidance for determining all applicable requirements including considerations for reducing the compliance burden and scope. Implement a process to periodically re-assess each application’s compliance requirements. Re-assessment includes reviewing all application functionality and opportunities to reduce scope to lower the overall cost of compliance.</p>
<p>Requirements include enough information for developers to understand functional and non-functional requirements of the different compliance obligations. They include references to policies and standards, and provide explicit references to regulations. If there are questions about the implementation of a particular requirement, the original text of the regulation can help interpret the intent more accurately. Each requirement includes a set of test scripts for verifying compliance. In addition to assisting QA with compliance verification, these can help clarify compliance requirements for developers and make the compliance process transparent. Requirements have a format that allows importing them into individual requirements repositories. further clarify compliance requirements for developers and ensure the process of achieving compliance is fully transparent.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Adequate security knowledge of all employees ensured prior to working on critical tasks</i></p>
<p>Implement a formal training program requiring anyone involved with the software development lifecycle to complete appropriate role and technology-specific training as part of the onboarding process. Based on the criticality of the application and user’s role, consider restricting access until the onboarding training has been completed. While the organization may source some modules externally, the program is facilitated and managed in-house and includes content specific to the organization going beyond general security best practices. The program has a defined curriculum, checks participation, and tests understanding and competence. The training consists of a combination of industry best practices and organization’s internal standards, including training on specific systems used by the organization.</p>
<p>In addition to issues directly related to security, the organization includes other standards to the program, such as code complexity, code documentation, naming convention, and other process-related disciplines. This training minimizes issues resulting from employees following practices incorporated outside the organization and ensures continuity in the style and competency of the code.</p>
<p>To facilitate progress monitoring and successful completion of each training module the organization has a learning management platform or another centralized portal with similar functionality. Employees can monitor their progress and have access to all training resources even after they complete initial training.</p>
<p>Review issues resulting from employees not following established standards, policies, procedures, or security best practices at least annually to gauge the effectiveness of the training and ensure it covers all issues relevant to the organization.

<p>Security is the responsibility of all employees, not just the Information Security team. Deploy communication and knowledge sharing platforms to help developers build communities around different technologies, tools, and programming languages. In these communities employees share information, discuss challenges with other developers, and search the knowledge base for answers to previously discussed issues.</p>
<p>Form communities around roles and responsibilities and enable developers and engineers from different teams and business units to communicate freely and benefit from each other’s expertise. Encourage participation, set up a program to promote those who help the most people as thought leaders, and have management recognize them. In addition to improving application security, this platform may help identify future members of the Secure Software Center of Excellence, or ‘Security Champions’ based on their expertise and willingness to help others.</p>
<p>The Secure Software Center of Excellence and Application Security teams review the information portal regularly for insights into the new and upcoming technologies, as well as opportunities to assist the development community with new initiatives, tools, programs, and training resources.

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Ability to classify applications according to risk</i></p>
<p>Use a simple method to evaluate the application risk per application, estimating the potential business impact that it poses for the organization in case of an attack. To achieve this, evaluate the impact of a breach in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data or service. Consider using a set of 5-10 questions to understand important application characteristics, such as whether the application processes financial data, whether it is internet facing, or whether privacy-related data is involved. The application risk profile tells you whether these factors are applicable and if they could significatly impact the organization.</p>
<p>Next, use a scheme to classify applications according to this risk. A simple, qualitative scheme (e.g. high/medium/low) that translates these characteristics into a value is often effective. It is important to use these values to represent and compare the risk of different applications against each other. Mature highly risk-driven organizations might make use of more quantitative risk schemes. Don’t invent a new risk scheme if your organization already has one that works well.</p>
<h6 id="assessment-questions-18">Assessment Question(s)</h6>

</ul>
<h5 id="stream-b-perform-basic-threat-modeling">[Stream B] Perform basic threat modeling</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Identification of architectural design flaws in your applications</i></p>
<p>Threat modeling is a structured activity for identifying, evaluating, and managing system threats, architectural design flaws, and recommended security mitigations. It is typically done as part of the design phase or as part of a security assessment.</p>
<p>Threat modeling is a team exercise, including product owners, architects, security champions, and security testers. At this maturity level, expose teams and stakeholders to threat modeling to increase security awareness and to create a shared vision on the security of the system.</p>
<p>At maturity level 1, you perform threat modeling ad-hoc for high-risk applications and use simple threat checklists, such as STRIDE. Avoid lengthy workshops and overly detailed lists of low-relevant threats. Perform threat modeling iteratively to align to more iterative development paradigms. If you add new functionality to an existing application, look only into the newly added functions instead of trying to cover the entire scope. A good starting point is the existing diagrams that you annotate during discussion workshops. Always make sure to persist the outcome of a threat modeling discussion for later use.</p>
<p>Your most important tool to start threat modeling is a whiteboard, smartboard, or a piece of paper. Aim for security awareness, a simple process, and actionable outcomes that you agree upon with your team.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Solid understanding of the risk level of your application portfolio</i></p>
<p>The goal of this activity is to thoroughly understand the risk level of all applications within the organization, to focus the effort of your software assurance activities where it really matters.</p>
<p>From a risk evaluation perspective, the basic set of questions is not enough to thoroughly evaluate the risk of all applications. Create an extensive and standardized way to evaluate the risk of the application, among others via their impact on information security (confidentiality, integrity and availability of data). Next to security, you also want to evaluate the privacy risk of the application. Understand the data that the application processes and what potential privacy violations are relevant. Finally, study the impact that this application has on other applications within the organization (e.g., the application might be modifying data that was considered read-only in another context). Evaluate all applications within the organization, including all existing and legacy ones.</p>
<p>Leverage business impact analysis to quantify and classify application risk. A simple qualitative scheme (such as high/medium/low) is not enough to effectively manage and compare applications on an enterprise-wide level.</p>
<p>Based on this input, Security Officers leverage the classification to define the risk profile to build a centralized inventory of risk profiles and manage accountability. This inventory gives Product Owners, Managers, and other organizational stakeholders an aligned view of the risk level of an application in order to assign appropriate priority to security-related activities.</p>
<h6 id="assessment-questions-20">Assessment Question(s)</h6>

<p>Use a standardized threat modeling methodology for your organization and align this on your application risk levels. Think about ways to support the scaling of threat modeling throughout the organization.</p>
<p>Train your architects, security champions, and other stakeholders on how to do practical threat modeling. Threat modeling requires understanding, clear playbooks and templates, organization-specific examples, and experience, which is hard to automate.</p>
<p>Your threat modeling methodology includes at least diagramming, threat identification, design flaw mitigations, and how to validate your threat model artifacts. Your threat model diagram allows a detailed understanding of the environment and the mechanics of the application. You discover threats to your application with checklists, such as STRIDE or more organization-specific threats. For identified design flaws (ranked according to risk for your organization), you add mitigating controls to support stakeholders in dealing with particular threats. Define what triggers updating a threat model, for example, a technology change or deployment of an application in a new environment.</p>
<p>Feed the output of threat modeling to the defect management process for adequate follow-up. Capture the threat modeling artifacts with tools that are used by your application teams.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Timely update of the application classification in case of changes</i></p>
<p>The application portfolio of an organization changes, as well as the conditions and constraints in which an application lives (e.g., driven by the company strategy). Periodically review the risk inventory to ensure correctness of the risk evaluations of the different applications.</p>
<p>Have a periodic review at an enterprise-wide level. Also, as your enterprise matures in software assurance, stimulate teams to continuously question which changes in conditions might impact the risk profile. For instance, an internal application might become exposed to the internet by a business decision. This should trigger the teams to rerun the risk evaluation and update the application risk profile accordingly.</p>
<p>In a mature implementation of this practice, train and continuously update teams on lessons learned and best practices from these risk evaluations. This leads to a better execution and a more accurate representation of the application risk profile.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-identify-security-requirements">[Stream A] Identify security requirements</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of key security requirements during development</i></p>
<p>Perform a review of the functional requirements of the software project. Identify relevant security requirements (i.e. expectations) for this functionality by reasoning on the desired confidentiality, integrity or availability of the service or data offered by the software project. Requirements state the objective (e.g., “personal data for the registration process should be transferred and stored securely”), but not the actual measure to achieve the objective (e.g., “use TLSv1.2 for secure transfer”).</p>
<p>At the same time, review the functionality from an attacker perspective to understand how it could be misused. This way you can identify extra protective requirements for the software project at hand.</p>
<p>Security objectives can relate to specific security functionality you need to add to the application (e.g., “Identify the user of the application at all times”) or to the overall application quality and behavior (e.g., “Ensure personal data is properly protected in transit”), which does not necessarily lead to new functionality. Follow good practices for writing security requirements. Make them specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). Beware of adding requirements too general-purpose to not relate to the application at hand (e.g., The application should protect against the OWASP Top 10). While they can be true, they don’t add value to the discussion.</p>

<p>The security competences and habits of the expernal suppliers involved in the development of your software can have a significant impact on the security posture of the final product. Consequently, it is important to know and evaluate your suppliers on this front.</p>
<p>Carry out a vendor assessment to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your suppliers. Use a basic checklist or conduct interviews to review their typical practices and deliveries. This gives you an idea of how they organize themselves and elements to evaluate whether you need to take additional measures to mitigate potential risks. Ideally, speak to different roles in the organization, or even set up a small maturity evaluation to this end. Strong suppliers will run their own software assurance program and will be able to answer most of your questions. If suppliers have weak competences in software security, discuss with them how and to what extent they plan to work on this and evaluate whether this is enough for your organization. A software supplier might be working on a low-risk project, but this could change.</p>
<p>It is important that your suppliers understand and align to the risk appetite and are able to meet your requirements in that area. Make what you expect from them explicit and discuss this clearly.</p>

<p>Security requirements can originate from other sources including policies and legislation, known problems within the application, and intelligence from metrics and feedback. At this level, a more systematic elicitation of security requirements must be achieved by analysing different sources of such requirements. Ensure that appropriate input is received from these sources to help the elicitation of requirements. For example, organize interviews or brainstorm sessions (e.g., in the case of policy and legislation), analyze historical logs or vulnerability systems.</p>
<p>Use a structured notation of security requirements across applications and an appropriate formalism that integrates well with how you specify other (functional) requirements for the project. This could mean, for example, extending analysis documents, writing user stories, etc.</p>
<p>When requirements are specified, it is important to ensure that these requirements are taken into account during product development. Setup a mechanism to stimulate or force project teams to meet these requirements in the product. For example, annotate requirements with priorities, or influence the handling of requirements to enforce sufficient security appetite (while balancing against other non-functional requirements).</p>

Discuss concrete responsibilities and expectations from your suppliers and your own organization and establish a contract with the supplier. The responsibilities can be specific quality requirements or particular tasks, and minimal service can be detailed in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). A quality requirement example is that they will deliver software that is protected against the OWASP Top 10, and in case issues are detected, these will be fixed. A task example is that they have to perform continuous static code analysis, or perform an independent penetration test before a major release. The agreement stipulates liabilities and caps in case an important issue arises.</p>
<p>Once you have implemented this for a few suppliers, work towards a standard agreement for suppliers that forms the basis of your negotiations. You can deviate from this standard agreement on a case by case basis, but it will help you to ensure you do not overlook important topics.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-provide-preferred-security-solutions">[Stream A] Provide preferred security solutions</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Reusable security services available for product teams</i></p>
<p>Identify shared infrastructure or services with security functionality. These typically include single-sign-on services, access control or entitlements services, logging and monitoring services or application-level firewalling. Collect and evaluate reusable systems to assemble a list of such resources and categorize them by the security mechanism they fulfill. Consider each resource in terms of why a product team would want to integrate with it, i.e. the benefits of using the shared resource.</p>
<p>If multiple resources exist in each category, select and standardize on one or more shared service per category. Because future software development will rely on these services, review each thoroughly to ensure understanding of the baseline security posture. For each selected service, create design guidance for product teams to understand how to integrate with the system. Make the guidance available through training, mentorship, guidelines, and standards.</p>
<p>Establish a set of best practices representing sound methods of implementing security functionality. You can research them or purchase them, and it is often more effective if you customize them so they are more specific to your organization. Example patterns include a single-sign-on subsystem, a cross-tier delegation model, a separation-of-duties authorization model, a centralized logging pattern, etc.</p>
<p>These patterns can originate from specific projects or applications, but make sure you share them between different teams across the organization for efficient and consistent application of appropriate security solutions.</p>
<p>To increase adoption of these patterns, link them to the shared security services, or implement them into actual component solutions that can be easily integrated into an application during development. Support the key technologies within the organization, for instance in case of different development stacks. Treat these solutions as actual applications with proper support in case of questions or issues.</p>

<p>Build a set of reference architectures that select and combine a verified set of security components to ensure a proper design of security. Reference platforms have advantages in terms of shortening audit and security-related reviews, increasing efficiency in development, and lowering maintenance overhead. Continuously maintain and improve the reference architecture based on new insights in the organization and within the community. Have architects, senior developers and other technical stakeholders participate in design and creation of reference platforms. After creation, teams maintain ongoing support and updates.</p>
<p>Reference architectures may materialize into a set of software libraries and tools upon which project teams build their software. They serve as a starting point that standardizes the configuration-driven, security-by-default security approach. You can bootstrap the framework by selecting a particular project early in the lifecycle and having security-savvy staff work with them to build the security functionality in a generic way so that it can be extracted from the project and used elsewhere in the organization.</p>
<p>Monitor weaknesses or gaps in the set of security solutions available in your organization continuously in the context of discussions on architecture, development, or operations.

<p>Keep a record of all dependencies used throughout the target production environment. This is sometimes referred to as a Bill of Materials (BOM). Consider that different components of the application may consume entirely different dependencies. For example, if the software package is a web application, cover both the server-side application code and client-side scripts. In building these records, consider the various locations where dependencies might be specified such as configuration files, the project’s directory on disk, a package management tool or the actual code (e.g. via an IDE that supports listing dependencies).</p>

<p>Automate the build process so that builds can be executed consistently anytime. The build process shouldn’t typically require any intervention, further reducing the likelihood of human error.</p>
<p>The use of an automated system increases reliance on security of the build tooling and makes hardening and maintaining the toolset even more critical. Pay particular attention to the interfaces of those tools, such as web-based portals and how they can be locked-down. The exposure of a build tool to the network could allow a malicious actor to tamper with the integrity of the process. This might, for example, allow malicious code to be built into software.</p>
<p>The automated process may require access to credentials and secrets required to build the software, such as the code signing certificate or access to repositories. Handle these with care. Sign generated artifacts using a certificate that identifies the organization or business unit that built it, so you can verify its integrity.</p>
<p>Finally, add appropriate automated security checks (e.g. using SAST tools) in the pipeline to leverage the automation for security benefit.</p>

<p>Perform security verification activites against dependencies on the whitelist in a comparable way to the target applications themselves (esp. using SAST and analyzing transitive dependencies). Ensure that these checks also aim to identify possible backdoors or easter eggs in the dependencies. Establish vulnerability disclosure processes with the dependency authors including SLAs for fixing issues. In case enforcing SLAs is not realistic (e.g. with open source vulnerabilities), ensure that the most probable cases are expected and you are able to implement compensating measures in a timely manner.

The test objective is to validate that the security controls are correctly implemented.</p>
<p>The security testing validates the relevant software security controls. Perform control-verification security tests manually or with tools, each time the application changes its use of the controls. Techniques such as feature toggles and A/B testing can be used to progressively expose features to broader audiences as they are sufficiently validated. Software control verification is mandatory for all software that is part of the SAMM program.</p>

Fuzz testing or Fuzzing is a Black Box software testing technique, which consists of finding implementation bugs using automated malformed or semi-malformed data injection. Cover at least a minimum fuzzing for vulnerabilities against the main input parameters of the application.</p>
<p>The advantage of fuzz testing is the simplicity of the test design, and its lack of preconceptions about system behavior. The stochastic approach results in bugs that human eyes or structured testing would often miss. It is also one of the few means of assessing the quality of a closed system (such as a SIP phone). The simplicity of fuzzing a target is offset by the difficulty in accurately detecting and triaging crashes. Favour existing fuzzing tools and frameworks to leverage their supporting tooling.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-define-and-run-security-test-cases-from-requirements">[Stream A] Define and run security test cases from requirements</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Integration of security requirements into test scenarios</i></p>
<p>From the security requirements, identify and implement a set of security test cases to check the software for correct functionality. To have a successful testing program, you must know the testing objectives, specified by the security requirements.</p>
<p>Derive security test cases for the applications in scope from the security requirements created as part of the “Security Requirements” SAMM security practice. To validate security requirements with security tests, security requirements are function-driven and highlight the expected functionality (the what) and, implicitly, the implementation (the how). These requirements are also referred to as “positive requirements”, since they state the expected functionality that can be validated through security tests. Examples of positive requirements include “the application will lockout the user after six failed login attempts” or “passwords need to be a minimum of six alphanumeric characters”. The validation of positive requirements consists of asserting the expected functionality. You can do it re-creating the testing conditions and running the test according to predefined inputs. Show the results as as a fail or pass condition.</p>
<p>Often, it is most effective to use the project team’s time to build application-specific test cases, and publicly available resources or purchased knowledge bases to select applicable general test cases for security. Relevant development, security, and quality assurance staff review candidate test cases for applicability, efficacy, and feasibility. Derive the test cases during the requirements and/or design phase of the functionality. Testing the security requirements is part of the functional testing of the software.</p>

<p>Misuse and abuse cases describe unintended and malicious use scenarios of the application, describing how an attacker could do this. Create misuse and abuse cases to misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application. Use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security tests that directly or indirectly exploit the abuse scenarios.</p>
<p>Abuse of functionality, sometimes referred to as a “business logic attack”, depends on the design and implementation of application functions and features. An example is using a password reset flow to enumerate accounts. As part of business logic testing, identify the business rules that are important for the application and turn them into experiments to verify whether the application properly enforces the business rule. For example, on a stock trading application, is the attacker allowed to start a trade at the beginning of the day and lock in a price, hold the transaction open until the end of the day, then complete the sale if the stock price has risen or cancel if the price dropped?</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-automate-security-requirements-testing">[Stream A] Automate security requirements testing</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Timely and reliable detection of violations to security requirements</i></p>
<p>Write and automate regression tests for all identified (and fixed) bugs to ensure that these become a test harness preventing similar issues being introduced during later releases. Security unit tests should verify dynamically (i.e., at run time) that the components function as expected and should validate that code changes are properly implemented.</p>
<p>A good practice for developers is to build security test cases as a generic security test suite that is part of the existing unit testing framework. A generic security test suite might include security test cases to validate both positive and negative requirements for security controls such as Identity, Authentication &amp; Access Control, Input Validation &amp; Encoding, User and Session Management, Error and Exception Handling, Encryption, and Auditing and Logging. Verify the correct execution of the security tests as early as possible. If feasible for example, consider the passing of security tests as part of merge requirements before allowing new code to enter the main code base. Alternatively, consider their passing a requirement for validating a build.</p>
<p>For security functional tests, use unit level tests for the functionality of security controls at the software component level, such as functions, methods, or classes. For example, a test case could check input and output validation (e.g., variable sanitation) and boundary checks for variables by asserting the expected functionality of the component.</p>

<h5 id="stream-b-perform-security-stress-testing">[Stream B] Perform security stress testing</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Transparency of resilience against denial of service attacks</i></p>
<p>Applications are particularly susceptible to denial of service attacks. Perform denial of service and security stress testing against them in controlled conditiions, preferably on application acceptance environments.</p>
<p>Load testing tools generate synthetic traffic, allowing you to test the application’s performance under heavy load. One important test is how many requests per second an application can handle while remaining within its performance requirements. Testing from a single IP address is still useful as it gives an indication of how many requests an attacker must generate to impact the application.</p>
<p>Denial of service attacks typically result in application resource starvation or exhaustion. To determine if any resources can be used to create a denial of service, analyze each application resource to see how it can be exhausted. Prioritise actions unauthenticated user can do. Complement overall denial of service tests with security stress tests to perform actions or create conditions which cause delays, disruptions, or failures of the application under test.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-perform-automated-security-testing">[Stream A] Perform automated security testing</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Detection of common easy-to-find vulnerabilities</i></p>
<p>Use automated static and dynamic security test tools for software, resulting in more efficient security testing and higher quality results. Progressively increase the frequency of security tests and extend code coverage.</p>
<p>Application security testing can be performed statically, by inspecting an application’s source code without running it, or dynamically by simply observing the application’s behavior in response to various input conditions. The former approach is often referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), the latter as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). A hybrid approach, known as Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), combines the strengths of both approaches (at the cost of additional overhead) by dynamically testing automatically instrumented applications, allowing accurate monitoring of the application’s internal state in response to external input.</p>
<p>Many security vulnerabilties are very hard to detect without carefully inspecting the source code. While this is ideally performed by expert or peer review, it is a slow and expensive task. Although “noisier” and frequently less accurate than expert-led reviews, automated SAST tools are cheaper, much faster, and more consitent than humans. A number of commercial and free tools are able to efficiently detect sufficiently important bugs and vulnerabilities in large code bases.</p>
<p>Dynamic testing does not require application source code, making it ideal for cases where source code is not available. It also identifies concrete instances of vulnerabilities. Due to its “black-box” approach , without instrumentation, it is more likely to uncover shallow bugs. Dynamic testing tools need a large source of test data whose manual test generation is prohibitive. Many tools exist which generate suitable test data automatically, leading to more efficient security testing and higher quality results.</p>
<p>Select appropriate tools based on several factors, including depth and accuracy of inspection, robustness and accuracy of security test cases, available integrations with other tools, usage and cost model, etc. When selecting tools, use input from security-savvy technical staff as well as developers and development managers and review results with stakeholders.</p>

<p>Perform selective manual security testing, possibly using a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools to guide or focus the review, in order to more thoroughly analyze parts of the application, as an attacker. Automated tools are effective at finding various types of vulnerabilities but can never replace expert manual review.</p>
<p>Code-level vulnerabilities in security-critical parts of software can have dramatically increased impact so project teams review high-risk modules for common vulnerabilities. Common examples of high-risk functionality include authentication modules, access control enforcement points, session management schemes, external interfaces, and input validators and data parsers. Teams can combine code-level metrics and focused automated scans to determine where best to focus their efforts. In practice, the activity can take many forms including pair programming and peer review, time-boxed security “pushes” involving the entire development team, or spontaneous independent reviews by members of a specialised security group.</p>
<p>During development cycles where high-risk code is changed and reviewed, development managers triage the findings and prioritize remediation appropriately with input from other project stakeholders.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-develop-application-specific-security-test-cases">[Stream A] Develop application-specific security test cases</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Detection of organization-specific easy-to-find vulnerabilites</i></p>
<p>Increase the effectiveness of automated security testing tools by tuning and customizing them for your particular technology stacks and applications. Automated security testing tools have 2 important characteristics: Their false positive rate, i.e. the non-existent bugs and vulnerabilities they incorrectly report; their false negative rate, i.e. actual bugs and vulnerabilities which they fail to detect. As you mature in your use of automated testing tools, you strive to minimize their false positive and false negative rates. This maximizes the time development teams spend reviewing and addressing real security issues in their applications, and reduces the friction typically associated with using untuned automated security analysis tools.</p>
<p>Start by disabling tool support for technologies and frameworks you do not use and target specific versions where possible. This will increase execution speed and reduce the number spurious results reported. Rely on security tool champions or shared security teams to pilot the tools in coordination with a select group of motivated development teams. This will identify likely false positive findings to ignore or remove from the tools’ output. Identify specific security issues and anti-patterns and favor the best tool for detecting them.</p>
<p>Leverage available tool features to take application-specific and organizational coding styles, as well as technical standards into account. Many automated static analysis tools allow users to write their own rules or customize default analysis rules to the specific software interfaces in the project under test for improved accuracy and depth of coverage. For example, potentially dangerous input (aka tainted) can be marked as safe after it flows through a designated custom sanitization method.</p>
<p>Strategically, it is better to reliably detect a limited subset of security issues via automated tooling, and incrementally extend coverage than attempting to detect all known issues immediately. Once the tools have been sufficiently tuned, they can be made available to a more development teams. It is important to continuously monitor their perceived efficacy among development teams. In more advanced forms, machine learning techniques can be adopted to identify and automatically filter out likely false positives at scale.</p>

<h5 id="stream-b-establish-a-penetration-testing-process">[Stream B] Establish a penetration testing process</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of application resilience from black-box perspective</i></p>
<p>Using the set of security test cases identified for each project, conduct manual penetration testing to evaluate the system’s performance against each case. Generally, this happens during the testing phase prior to release and includes both static and dynamic manual penetration testing. In cases where software cannot be realistically tested outside of production, use of techniques such as blue-green deployments or A/B testing can allow ring-fenced security testing in production.</p>
<p>Penetration testing cases include both application-specific tests to check soundness of business logic, and common vulnerability tests to check the design and implementation. Once specified, security-savvy quality assurance or development staff can execute security test cases. The central software security group monitors first-time execution of security test cases for a project team to assist and coach the team security champions.</p>
<p>Many organizations offer “Bug Bunty” programmes which invite security researchers to find vulnerabilties in applications and report them responsibly in exchange for rewards. The approach allows organizations to access a bigger pool of talent, especially those lacking sufficient internal capacity or requiring the additional assurance.</p>
<p>Prior to release or mass deployment, stakeholders review results of security tests and accept the risks indicated by failing security tests at release time. Establish a concrete timeline to address the gaps over time. Spread the knowledge of manual security testing and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organization.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Identification of automatically identifiable vulnerabilities in earliest possible stages</i></p>
<p>Projects within the organization routinely run automated security tests and review results during development. Configure security testing tools to automatically run as part of the build and deploy process to make this scalable with low overhead. Inspect findings as they occur.</p>
<p>Conducting security tests as early as the requirements or design phases can be beneficial. While traditionally used for functional test cases, this type of test-driven development approach involves identifying and running relevant security test cases early in the development cycle. With the automatic execution of security test cases, projects enter the implementation phase with a number of failing tests for the non-existent functionality. Implementation is complete when all the tests pass. This provides a clear, upfront goal for developers early in the development cycle, lowering risk of release delays due to security concerns or forced acceptance of risk to meet project deadlines.</p>
<p>Make the results of automated and manual security tests visible via dashboards, and routinely present them to management and business stakeholders (e.g. before each release) for review. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them. Continuously review and improve the quality of the security tests.</p>
<p>Consider and implement security test correlation tools to automate the matching and merging of test results from dynamic, static, and interactive application scanners into one central dashboard, providing direct input towards Defect Management.

<p>With the multiplicity of security tools running at every phase of development, remediating security issues at a designated stage (such as pre-release testing) is no longer appropriate or desirable. Security issues must be quickly triaged and fixes planned in a tradeoff between risk and cost of remediation. Continuously striving to detect issues earlier in the development lifecycle, via specific, low-friction automated tests integrated into development tools and build processes, lowers the cost of remediation thereby increasing the likelihood of issues being quickly resolved.</p>
<p>Proactively improve the security testing effort integrated into the development process by adequately propagating the results of other security test activities. For example, if a security penetration test identifies issues with session management, any changes to session management should trigger explicit security tests before pushing the changes to production.</p>
<p>Security champions and the central secure software group continuously review results from automated and manual security tests during development, including these results as part of the security awareness trainings for the development teams.

<h5 id="stream-b-practice-best-effort-patching">[Stream B] Practice best-effort patching</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Mitigation of well-known issues in third-party components</i></p>
<p>Identify applications and third-party components which need to be updated or patched, including underlying operating systems, application servers, and third-party code libraries.</p>
<p>At this level of maturity, your identification and patching activities are best-effort and <em>ad hoc</em>, without a managed process for tracking component versions, available updates, and patch status. However, high-level requirements for patching activities (e.g., testing patches before pushing to production) may exist, and product teams are achieving best-effort compliance with those requirements.</p>
<p>Except for critical security updates (e.g., an exploit for a third-party component has been publicly released), teams leverage maintenance windows established for other purposes to apply component patches. For software developed by the organization, component patches are delivered to customers and organization-managed solutions only as part of feature releases.</p>
<p>Teams share their awareness of available updates, and their experiences with patching, on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. Ensure teams can determine the versions of all components in use, to evaluate whether their products are affected by a security vulnerability when notified. However, the process for generating and maintaining component lists may require significant analyst effort.</p>

<h5 id="stream-a-establish-hardening-baselines">[Stream A] Establish hardening baselines</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Consistent hardening of technology stack components in your organization</i></p>
<p>Establsh configuration hardening baselines for all components in each technology stack used. To assist with consistent application of the hardening baselines, develop configuration guides for the components. Require product teams to apply configuration baselines to all new systems, and to existing systems when practicable.</p>
<p>Place hardening baselines and configuration guides under change management, and assign an owner to each. Owners have ongoing responsibility to keep them up-to-date, based on evolving best practices or changes to the relevant components (e.g., version updates, new features).</p>
<p>In larger environments, derive configurations of instances from a locally maintained master, with relevant configuration baselines applied. Employ automated tools for hardening configurations.</p>

<h5 id="stream-b-formalize-patch-management">[Stream B] Formalize patch management</h5>
<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Consistent and proactive patching of technology stack components</i></p>
<p>Develop and follow a well-defined process for managing patches to application components across the technology stacks in use. Ensure processes include regular schedules for applying vendor updates, aligned with vendor update calendars (e.g., Microsoft Patch Tuesday). For software developed by the organization, deliver releases to customers and organization-managed solutions on a regular basis (e.g., monthly), regardless of whether you are including new features.</p>
<p>Create guidance for prioritizing component patching, reflecting your risk tolerance and management objectives. Consider operational factors (e.g., criticality of the application, severity of the vulnerabilities addressed) in determining priorities for testing and applying patches.</p>
<p>In the event receive a notification for a critical vulnerability in a component, while no patch is yet available, triage and handle the situation as a risk management issue (e.g., implement compensating controls, obtain customer risk acceptance, or disable affected applications/features).</p>

<p>Actively monitor the security configurations of deployed technology stacks, performing regular checks against established baselines. Ensure results of configuration checks are readily available, through published reports and dashboards.</p>
<p>When you detect non-conforming configurations, treat each occurrence as a security finding, and manage corrective actions within your established Defect Management practice.</p>
<p>Further gains may be realized using automated measures, such as “self-healing” configurations and security information and event management (SIEM) alerts.</p>
<p>As part of the process for updating components (e.g., new releases, vendor patches), review corresponding baselines and configuration guides, updating them as needed to maintain their relevance and accuracy. Review other baselines and configuration guides at least annually.</p>
<p>Periodically review your baseline management process, incorporating feedback and lessons learned from teams applying and maintaining configuration baselines and configuration guides.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of sensitivity of processed data with derived quick-win measures</i></p>
<p>Understand the types and sensitivity of data stored and processed by your applications, and maintain awareness of the fate of processed data (e.g., backups, sharing with external partners). At this level of maturity, the information gathered may be captured in varying forms and different places; no organization-wide data catalog is assumed to exist. Protect and handle all data associated with a given application according to protection requirements applying to the most sensitive data stored and processed.</p>
<p>Implement basic controls, to prevent propagation of unsanitized sensitive data from production environments to lower environments. By ensuring unsanitized production data are never propagated to lower (non-production) environments, you can focus data protection policies and activities on production.</p>
<h6 id="assessment-questions-84">Assessment Question(s)</h6>

<p>Identify unused applications on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis, either by chance observation, or by occasionally performing a review. When you identify unused applications, process those findings for further action. If you have established a formal process for decommissioning unused applications, ensure teams are aware of and use it.</p>
<p>Manage customer/user migration from older versions of your products for each product and customer/user group. When a product version is no longer in use by any customer/user group, discontinue support for that version. However, at this level of maturity you may have a large number of product versions in active use across the customer/user base, requiring significant developer effort to back-port product fixes.</p>

<p><b>Benefit</b>: <i>Standardized handling of different classes of sensitive data</i></p>
<p>At this maturity level, Data Protection activities focus on actively managing your stewardship of data. Establish technical and administrative controls to protect the confidentiality of sensitive data, and the integrity and availability of all data in your care, from its initial creation/receipt through the destruction of backups at the end of their retention period.</p>
<p>Identify the data stored, processed, and transmitted by applications, and capture information regarding their types, sensitivity (classification) levels, and storage location(s) in your data catalog. Clearly identify records or data elements subject to specific regulation. Establishing a single source of truth regarding the data you work with supports finer-grained selection of controls for their protection. Collecting this information enhances the accuracy, timeliness, and efficiency of your responses to data-related queries (e.g., from auditors, incident response teams, or customers), and supports threat modeling and compliance activities.</p>
<p>Based on your Data Protection Policy, establish processes and procedures for protecting and preserving data throughout their lifetime, whether at rest, while being processed, or in transit. Pay particular attention to the handling and protection of sensitive data outside the active processing system, including, but not limited to: storage, retention, and destruction of backups; and the labeling, encryption, and physical protection of offline storage media. Your processes and procedures cover the implementation of all controls adopted to comply with regulatory, contractual, or other restrictions on storage locations, personnel access, and other factors.</p>
