### Incident Management (IM3)

The goal of this practice level is to mature incident management

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Improve the incident detection process
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Ability to timely detect security incidents</i>

Ensure process documentation includes measures for continuous process improvement. Check the continuity of process improvement (e.g., via tracking of changes).

Ensure the checklist for suspicious event detection is correlated at least from (i) sources and knowledge bases external to the company (e.g., new vulnerability announcements affecting the used technologies), (ii) past security incidents, and (iii) threat model outcomes.

Use correlation of logs for incident detection for all reasonable incident scenarios. If the log data for incident detection is not available, document its absence as a defect, triage and handle it according to your established Defect Management process.

The quality of the incident detection does not depend on the time or day of the event. If security events are not acknowledged and resolved within a specified time (e.g., 20 minutes), ensure further notifications are generated according to an established escalation path.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you review and update the incident detection process regularly?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You perform reviews at least annually
- You update the checklist of potential attacks with external and internal data


##### [Stream B] Establish an incident response team
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Efficient incident response independent of time, location, or type of incident</i>

Establish a dedicated incident response team, continuously available and responsible for continuous process improvement with the help of regular RCAs. For distributed organizations, define and document logistics rules for all relevant locations if sensible.

Document detailed incident response procedures and keep them up to date. Automate procedures where appropriate. Keep all resources necessary for these procedures (e.g., separate communicating infrastructure or reliable external location) ready to use. Detect and correct unavailability of these resources in a timely manner.

Carry out incident and emergency exercises are regularly. Use the results for process improvement.

Define, gather, evaluate, and act upon metrics on the incident response process, including its continuous improvement.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you have a dedicated incident response team available?

- No
- Yes, some of the time
- Yes, at least half of the time
- Yes, most or all of the time


Quality Criteria:

- The team performs Root Cause Analysis for all security incidents unless there is a specific reason not to do so
- You review and update the response process at least annually
