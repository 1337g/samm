### Policy & Compliance (PC1)

The goal of this practice level is to identify and document governance and compliance drivers relevant to the organization.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Define policies and standards
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Clear expectation of minimum security level in the organization</i>

Develop a library of policies and standards to govern all aspects of software development in the organization. Policies and standards are based on existing industry standards and appropriate for the organization’s industry. Due to the full range of technology-specific limitations and best practices, review proposed standards with the various product teams. With the overarching objective of increasing security of the applications and computing infrastructure, invite product teams to offer feedback on any aspects of the standards that would not be feasible or cost-effective to implement, as well as opportunities for standards to go further with little effort on the product teams.

For policies, emphasize high-level definitions and aspects of application security that do not depend on specific technology or hosting environment. Focus on broader objectives of the organization to protect the integrity of its computing environment, safety and privacy of the data, and maturity of the software development life-cycles. For larger organizations, policies may qualify specific requirements based on data classification or application functionality, but should not be detailed enough to offer technology-specific guidance.

For standards, incorporate requirements set forth by policies, and focus on technology-specific implementation guidance intended to capture and take advantage of the security features of different programming languages and frameworks. Standards require input from senior developers and architects considered experts in various technologies in use by the organization. Create them in a format that allows for periodic updates. Label or tag individual requirements with the policy or a 3rd party requirement, to make maintenance and audits easier and more efficient.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you have and apply a common set of policies and standards throughout your organization?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You have adapted existing standards appropriate for the organization’s industry to account for domain-specific considerations
- Your standards are aligned with your policies and incorporate technology-specific implementation guidance


##### [Stream B] Identify compliance requirements
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Security policies and standards aligned with external compliance drivers</i>

Create a comprehensive list of all compliance requirements, including any triggers that could help determine which applications are in scope. Compliance requirements may be considered in scope based on factors such as geographic location, types of data, or contractual obligations with clients or business partners. Review each identified compliance requirement with the appropriate experts and legal, to ensure the obligation is understood. Since many compliance obligations vary in applicability based on how the data is processed, stored, or transmitted across the computing environment, compliance drivers should always indicate opportunities for lowering the overall compliance burden by changing how the data is handled.

Evaluate publishing a compliance matrix to help identify which factors could put an application in scope for a specific regulatory requirement. Have the matrix indicate which compliance requirements are applicable at the organization level and do not depend on individual applications. The matrix provides at least a basic understanding of useful compliance requirements to review obligations around different applications.

Since many compliance standards are focused around security best-practices, many compliance requirements may already be a part of the Policy and Standards library published by the organization. Therefore, once you review compliance requirements, map them to any applicable existing policies and standards. Whenever there are discrepancies, update the policies and standards to include organization-wide compliance requirements. Then, begin creating compliance-specific standards only applicable to individual compliance requirements. The goal is to have a compliance matrix that indicates which policies and standards have more detailed information about compliance requirements, as well as ensure individual policies and standards reference applicable compliance requirements.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you have a complete picture of your external compliance obligations?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You have identified all sources of external compliance obligations
- You have captured and reconciled compliance obligations from all sources
