### Strategy & Metrics (SM3)

The goal of this practice level is to align security efforts with the relevant organizational indicators and asset values.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Align security and business strategies
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Continuous AppSec program alignment with the organization's business goals</i>

You review the application security plan periodically for ongoing applicability and support of the organization’s evolving needs and future growth. To do this, you repeat the steps from the first two maturity levels of this Security Practice at least annually. The goal is for the plan to always support the current and future needs of the organization, which ensures the program is aligned with the business.

In addition to reviewing the business drivers, the organization closely monitors the success of the implementation of each of the roadmap milestones. You evaluate the success of the milestones based on a wide range of criteria, including completeness and efficiency of the implementation, budget considerations, and any cultural impacts or changes resulting from the initiative. You review missed or unsatisfactory milestones and evaluate possible changes to the overall program.

The organization develops dashboards and measurements for management and teams responsible for software development to monitor the implementation of the roadmap. These dashboards are detailed enough to identify individual projects and initiatives and provide a clear understanding of whether the program is successful and aligned with the organization’s needs.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly review and update the Strategic Plan for Application Security?

- No
- Yes, but review is ad-hoc
- Yes, we review it at regular times
- Yes, we review it at least annually


Quality Criteria:

- You review and update the plan in response to significant changes in the business environment, the organization, or its risk appetite
- Plan update steps include reviewing the plan with all the stakeholders and updating the business drivers and strategies
- You adjust the plan and roadmap based on lessons learned from completed roadmap activities
- You publish progress information on roadmap activities, making sure they are available to all stakeholders


##### [Stream B] Drive the security program through metrics
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Continuous improvement of your program according to results</i>

Define guidelines for influencing the Application Security program based on the KPIs and other application security metrics. These guidelines  combine the maturity of the application development process and procedures  with different metrics to make the program more efficient. The following examples show a relationship between measurements and ways of evolving and improving application security

* Focus on maturity of the development lifecycle makes the relative cost per defect lower by applying security proactively.
* Monitoring the balance between effort, result, and environment metrics improves the program’s efficiency and justifies additional automation and other methods for improving the overall application security baselines.
* Individual Security Practices could provide indicators of success or failure of individual application security initiatives.
* Effort metrics helps ensure application security work is directed at the more relevant and important technologies and disciplines.

When defining the overall metrics strategy, keep the end-goal in mind and define what decisions can be made as a result of changes in KPIs and metrics as soon as possible, to help guide development of metrics.
