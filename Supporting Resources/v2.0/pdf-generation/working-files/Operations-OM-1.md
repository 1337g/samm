### Operational Management (OM1)

The goal of this practice level is to foundational Practices

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Organize basic data protections
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of sensitivity of processed data with derived quick-win measures</i>

Understand the types and sensitivity of data stored and processed by your applications, and maintain awareness of the fate of processed data (e.g., backups, sharing with external partners). At this level of maturity, the information gathered may be captured in varying forms and different places; no organization-wide data catalog is assumed to exist. Protect and handle all data associated with a given application according to protection requirements applying to the most sensitive data stored and processed.

Implement basic controls, to prevent propagation of unsanitized sensitive data from production environments to lower environments. By ensuring unsanitized production data are never propagated to lower (non-production) environments, you can focus data protection policies and activities on production.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you protect and handle information according to protection requirements for data stored and processed on each application?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You know the data elements processed and stored by each application
- You know the type and sensitivity level of each identified data element
- You have controls to prevent propagation of unsanitized sensitive data from production to lower environments


##### [Stream B] Identify unused applications
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Identification of unused of software assets or components</i>

Identify unused applications on an _ad hoc_ basis, either by chance observation, or by occasionally performing a review. When you identify unused applications, process those findings for further action. If you have established a formal process for decommissioning unused applications, ensure teams are aware of and use it.

Manage customer/user migration from older versions of your products for each product and customer/user group. When a product version is no longer in use by any customer/user group, discontinue support for that version. However, at this level of maturity you may have a large number of product versions in active use across the customer/user base, requiring significant developer effort to back-port product fixes.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you identify and remove systems, applications, application dependencies, or services that are no longer used, have reached end of life, or are no longer actively developed or supported?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You do not use unsupported applications or dependencies
- You manage customer/user migration from older versions for each product and customer/user group
