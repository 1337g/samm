### Education & Guidance (EG3)

The goal of this practice level is to develop in-house training programs facilitated by developers across different teams.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Standardize security guidance
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Adequate security knowledge of all employees ensured prior to working on critical tasks</i>

Implement a formal training program requiring anyone involved with the software development lifecycle to complete appropriate role and technology-specific training as part of the onboarding process. Based on the criticality of the application and user’s role, consider restricting access until the onboarding training has been completed. While the organization may source some modules externally, the program is facilitated and managed in-house and includes content specific to the organization going beyond general security best practices. The program has a defined curriculum, checks participation, and tests understanding and competence. The training consists of a combination of industry best practices and organization’s internal standards, including training on specific systems used by the organization.

In addition to issues directly related to security, the organization includes other standards to the program, such as code complexity, code documentation, naming convention, and other process-related disciplines. This training minimizes issues resulting from employees following practices incorporated outside the organization and ensures continuity in the style and competency of the code.

To facilitate progress monitoring and successful completion of each training module the organization has a learning management platform or another centralized portal with similar functionality. Employees can monitor their progress and have access to all training resources even after they complete initial training.

Review issues resulting from employees not following established standards, policies, procedures, or security best practices at least annually to gauge the effectiveness of the training and ensure it covers all issues relevant to the organization. Update the training periodically and train employees on any changes and most prevalent security deficiencies.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Have you implemented a Learning Management System or equivalent to track employee training and certification processes?

- No
- Yes, for some of the training
- Yes, for at least half of the training
- Yes, for most or all of the training


Quality Criteria:

- A Learning Management System (LMS) is used to track trainings and certifications
- Training is based on internal standards, policies, and procedures
- You use certification programs or attendance records to determine access to development systems and resources


##### [Stream B] Establish a security community
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Collective development of security know-how among all product teams</i>

Security is the responsibility of all employees, not just the Information Security team. Deploy communication and knowledge sharing platforms to help developers build communities around different technologies, tools, and programming languages. In these communities employees share information, discuss challenges with other developers, and search the knowledge base for answers to previously discussed issues.

Form communities around roles and responsibilities and enable developers and engineers from different teams and business units to communicate freely and benefit from each other's expertise. Encourage participation, set up a program to promote those who help the most people as thought leaders, and have management recognize them. In addition to improving application security, this platform may help identify future members of the Secure Software Center of Excellence, or 'Security Champions' based on their expertise and willingness to help others.

The Secure Software Center of Excellence and Application Security teams review the information portal regularly for insights into the new and upcoming technologies, as well as opportunities to assist the development community with new initiatives, tools, programs, and training resources. Use the portal to disseminate information about new standards, tools, and resources to all developers for the continued improvement of SDLC maturity and application security.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Is there a centralized portal where developers and application security professionals from different teams and business units are able to communicate and share information?

- No
- Yes, we started implementing it
- Yes, for part of the organization
- Yes, for the entire organization


Quality Criteria:

- The organization promotes use of a single portal across different teams and business units
- The portal is used for timely information such as notification of security incidents, tool updates, architectural standard changes, and other related announcements
- The portal is widely recognized by developers and architects as a centralized repository of the organization-specific application security information
- All content is considered persistent and searchable
- The portal provides access to application-specific security metrics
