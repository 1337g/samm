### Strategy & Metrics (SM2)

The goal of this practice level is to establish a unified strategic roadmap for software security within the organization.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Define the security strategy
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Available and agreed up roadmap of your AppSec program</i>

Based on the magnitude of assets, threats, and risk tolerance, develop a security strategic plan and budget to address business priorities around application security. The plan covers 1 to 3 years and includes milestones consistent with the organization’s business drivers and risks. It provides tactical and strategic initiatives and follows a roadmap that makes its alignment with business priorities and needs visible.

In the roadmap, you reach a balance between changes requiring financial expenditures, changes of processes and procedures, and changes impacting the organization’s culture. This balance helps accomplish multiple milestones concurrently and without overloading or exhausting available resources or development teams. The milestones are frequent enough to help monitor program success and trigger timely roadmap adjustments.

For the program to be successful, the application security team obtains buy-in from the organization’s stakeholders and application development teams. A published plan is available to anyone who is required to support or participate in its implementation.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you have a strategic plan for application security and use it to make decisions?

- No
- Yes, we review it annually
- Yes, we consult the plan before making significant decisions
- Yes, we consult the plan often, and it is aligned with our application security strategy


Quality Criteria:

- The plan reflects the organization's business priorities and risk appetite
- The plan includes measurable milestones and a budget
- The plan is consistent with the organization's business drivers and risks
- The plan lays out a roadmap for strategic and tactical initiatives
- You have buy-in from stakeholders, including development teams


##### [Stream B] Set strategic KPIs
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Transparency on your AppSec program's performance</i>

Once the organization has defined its application security metrics, collect enough information to establish realistic goals. Test identified metrics to ensure you can gather data consistently and efficiently over a short period. After the initial testing period, the organization should have enough information to commit to goals and objectives expressed through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

While several measurements are useful for monitoring the information security program and its effectiveness, KPIs are comprised of the most meaningful and effective metrics. Aim to remove volatility common in application development environments from KPIs to reduce chances of unfavorable numbers resulting from temporary or misleading individual measurements. Base KPIs on metrics considered valuable not only to Information Security professionals but also to individuals responsible for the overall success of the application, and organization’s leadership. View KPIs as definitive indicators of the success of the whole program and consider them actionable.

Fully document KPIs and distribute them to the teams contributing to the success of the program as well as organization’s leadership. Ideally, include a brief explanation of the information sources for each KPI and the meaning if the numbers are high or low. Include short and long-term goals, and ranges for unacceptable measurements requiring immediate intervention. Share action plans with application security and application development teams to ensure full transparency in understanding of the organization’s objectives and goals.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Did you define Key Perfomance Indicators (KPI) from available application security metrics?

- No
- Yes, for some of the metrics
- Yes, for at least half of the metrics
- Yes, for most or all of the metrics


Quality Criteria:

- You defined KPIs after gathering enough information to establish realistic objectives
- You developed KPIs with the buy-in from the leadership and teams responsible for application security
- KPIs are available to the application teams and include acceptability thresholds and guidance in case teams need to take action
- Success of the application security program is clearly visible based on defined KPIs
