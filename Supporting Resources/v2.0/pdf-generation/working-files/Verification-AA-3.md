### Architecture Assessment (AA3)

The goal of this practice level is to review the architecture effectiveness and feedback results to improve the security architecture.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Verify the effectiveness of security components
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Assurance of effectivness of architecture controls</i>

Review the effectiveness of the architecture components and their provided security mechanisms in terms of alignment with the overall strategy of the organization, and scrutinize the degree of availability, scalability and enterprise-readiness of the chosen security solutions. While tactical choices for a particular application can make sense in specific contexts, it is important to keep an eye on the bigger picture and ensure future readiness of the designed solution.

Feed any findings back into defect management to trigger further improvements to the architecture.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly review the effectiveness of the security controls?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You evaluate the preventive, detective, and response capabilities of security controls
- You evaluate the strategy alignment, appropriate support, and scalability of security controls
- You evaluate the effectiveness at least yearly
- You log identified shortcomings as defects


##### [Stream B] Feed review results back to improve reference architectures
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Continuous improvement of enterprise architecture based on architecture reviews</i>

As an organization, you can further improve your software security posture by understanding which threats remain unaddressed in the software architectures and adapting your tactics to prevent this. Formalize a process to use recurring architecture findings as a trigger to identify the causes of gaps in the security assessment and deal with them. Feed findings back to the Design phase by creating, or updating relevant reference architectures, existing security solutions, or organisation design principles and patterns.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly update your reference architectures based on architecture assessment findings?

- No
- Yes, for some applications
- Yes, for at least half of the applications
- Yes, for most or all of the applications


Quality Criteria:

- You assess your architectures in a standardized, documented manner
- You use recurring findings to trigger a review of reference architectures
- You independently review the quality of the architecture assessments on an ad-hoc basis
- You use reference architecture updates to trigger reviews of relevant shared solutions, in a risk-based manner
