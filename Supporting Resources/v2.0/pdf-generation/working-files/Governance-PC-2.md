### Policy & Compliance (PC2)

The goal of this practice level is to establish application-specific security and compliance baseline.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Develop test procedures
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Common understanding of how to reach compliance with security policies for product teams</i>

To assist with the ongoing implementation and verification of compliance with policies and standards, develop application security and appropriate test scripts related to each applicable requirement. Organize these documents into libraries and make them available to all application teams in formats most conducive for inclusion into each application. Clearly label the documents and link them to the policies and standards they represent, to assist with the ongoing updates and maintenance. Version policies and standards and include detailed change logs with each iterative update to make ongoing inclusion into different products’ SDLC easier.

Write application security requirements in a format consistent with the existing requirements management processes. You may need more than one version catering to different development methodologies or technologies. The goal is to make it easy for various product teams to incorporate policies and standards into their existing development life-cycles needing minimal interpretation of requirements.

Test scripts help reinforce application security requirements through clear expectations of application functionality, and guide automated or manual testing efforts that may already be part of the development process. These efforts not only help each team establish the current state of compliance with existing policies and standards, but also ensure compliance as applications continue to change.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you publish the organization's policies as test scripts or run-books for easy interpretation by development teams?

- No
- Yes, some content
- Yes, at least half of the content
- Yes, most or all of the content


Quality Criteria:

- You create verification checklists and test scripts where applicable, aligned with the policy's requirements and the implementation guidance in the associated standards
- You create versions adapted to each development methodology and technology the organization uses


##### [Stream B] Standardize policy and compliance requirements
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Common understanding how to reach compliance with external compliance drivers for product teams</i>

Develop a library of application requirements and test scripts to establish and verify regulatory compliance of applications. Some of these are tied to individual compliance requirements like PCI or GDPR, while others are more general in nature and address global compliance requirements such as ISO. The library is available to all application development teams. It includes guidance for determining all applicable requirements including considerations for reducing the compliance burden and scope. Implement a process to periodically re-assess each application’s compliance requirements. Re-assessment includes reviewing all application functionality and opportunities to reduce scope to lower the overall cost of compliance.

Requirements include enough information for developers to understand functional and non-functional requirements of the different compliance obligations. They include references to policies and standards, and provide explicit references to regulations. If there are questions about the implementation of a particular requirement, the original text of the regulation can help interpret the intent more accurately. Each requirement includes a set of test scripts for verifying compliance. In addition to assisting QA with compliance verification, these can help clarify compliance requirements for developers and make the compliance process transparent. Requirements have a format that allows importing them into individual requirements repositories. further clarify compliance requirements for developers and ensure the process of achieving compliance is fully transparent.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you have a standard set of security requirements and verification procedures addressing the organization's external compliance obligations?

- No
- Yes, for some obligations
- Yes, for at least half of the obligations
- Yes, for most or all of the obligations


Quality Criteria:

- You map each external compliance obligation to a well-defined set of application requirements
- You define verification procedures, including automated tests, to verify compliance with compliance-related requirements
