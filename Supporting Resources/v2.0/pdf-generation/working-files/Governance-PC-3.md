### Policy & Compliance (PC3)

The goal of this practice level is to measure adherence to policies, standards, and 3rd-party requirements.

#### Activities

##### [Stream A] Measure compliance to policies and standards
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of your organization’s compliance with policies and standards</i>

Develop a program to measure each application’s compliance with existing policies and standards. Mandatory requirements should be motivated and reported consistently across all teams. Whenever possible, tie compliance status into automated testing and report with each version. Compliance reporting includes the version of policies and standards and appropriate code coverage factors.

Encourage non-compliant teams to review available resources such as security requirements and test scripts, to ensure non-compliance is not a result of inadequate guidance. Forward issues resulting from insufficient guidance to the teams responsible for publishing application requirements and test scripts, to include them in the future releases. Escalate issues resulting from the inability to meet policies and standards the teams that handle application security risks.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly report on policy and standard compliance, and use that information to guide compliance improvement efforts?

- No
- Yes, but reporting is ad-hoc
- Yes, we report at regular times
- Yes, we report at least annually


Quality Criteria:

- You have procedures (automated, if possible) to regularly generate compliance reports
- You deliver compliance reports to all relevant stakeholders
- Stakeholders use the reported compliance status information to identify areas for improvement


##### [Stream B] Measure compliance to external requirements
<b>Benefit</b>: <i>Understanding of your organization’s compliance with external compliance drivers</i>

Develop a program for measuring and reporting on the status of compliance between different applications. Application requirements and test scripts help determine the status of compliance. Leverage testing automation to promptly detect compliance regressions in frequently updated applications and ensure compliance is maintained through the different application versions. Whenever fully automated testing is not possible, QA, Internal Audit, or Information Security teams assess compliance periodically through a combination of manual testing and interview.

While full compliance is always the ultimate goal, include tracking remediation actions and periodic updates in the program. Review compliance remediation activities periodically to check teams are making appropriate progress, and that remediation strategies will be effective in achieving compliance. To further improve the process, develop a series of standard reports and compliance scorecards. These help individual teams understand the current state of compliance, and the organization manage assistance for remediating compliance gaps more effectively.

Review compliance gaps requiring significant expenses or development with the subject-matter experts and compare them against the cost of reducing the application’s functionality, minimizing scope or eliminating the compliance requirement. longterm compliance gaps require management approval and a formal compliance risk acceptance, so they receive appropriate attention and scrutiny from the organization’s leadership.


###### Assessment Question(s)
Do you regularly report on adherence to external compliance obligations and use that information to guide efforts to close compliance gaps?

- No
- Yes, but reporting is ad-hoc
- Yes, we report at regular times
- Yes, we report at least annually


Quality Criteria:

- You have established, well-defined compliance metrics
- You measure and report on applications' compliance metrics regularly
- Stakeholders use the reported compliance status information to identify compliance gaps and prioritize gap remediation efforts
