# Overview of Business Functions
The SAMM model contains five business functions with three security practices each. This section provides a high level overview of each of the business functions.

## Governance
<i>Governance focuses on the processes and activities related to how an organization manages overall software development activities. More specifically, this includes concerns that impact cross-functional groups involved in development, as well as business processes established at the organization level.
</i>

**Strategy & Metrics** This practice forms the basis of your secure software activities by building an overall plan.

**Policy & Compliance** This practice drives the adherence to internal and external standards and regulations.

**Education & Guidance** This practice focuses on increasing the knowledge in the organization regarding secure software.

## Design
<i>Design concerns the processes and activities related to how an organization defines goals and creates software within development projects. In general, this will include requirements gathering, high-level architecture specification and detailed design.
</i>

**Threat Assessment** This practice focuses on identifying potential threats in applications.

**Security Requirements** This practice focuses on defining appropriate security requirements for your software and your software suppliers.

**Security Architecture** The security architecture practice focuses on managing architectural risks for the software solution.

## Implementation
<i>Implementation is focused on the processes and activities related to how an organization builds and deploys software components and its related defects.

   Activities within the Implementation function have the most impact on the daily life of developers. The joint goal is to ship reliably working software with minimum defects.
</i>

**Secure Build** This practice focuses on creating a consistently repeatable build process and accounting for the security of application dependencies.

**Secure Deployment** This practice focuses on increasing the security of software deployments to the production environment and the supporting secrets.

**Defect Management** This practice focuses on managing security defects in software and their associated metrics.

## Verification
<i>Verification focuses on the processes and activities related to how an organization checks and tests artifacts produced throughout software development. This typically includes quality assurance work such as testing, but it can also include other review and evaluation activities.
</i>

**Architecture Assessment** This practice focuses on validating the security and compliance of the software and supporting infrastructure architecture.

**Requirements-driven Testing** This practice focuses on using both positive (control verification) and negative (misuse/abuse testing) security tests based on requirements (user stories).

**Security Testing** This practice focuses on the detection and resolution of basic security issues through automation, allowing manual testing to focus on more complex attack vectors.

## Operations
<i>The Operations Business Function encompasses those activities necessary to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained throughout the operational lifetime of an application and its associated data. Increased maturity with regard to this Business Function provides greater assurance that the organization is resilient in the face of operational disruptions, and responsive to changes in the operational landscape.
</i>

**Incident Management** This practice addresses activities carried out improve the organization's detection of, and response to, security incidents.

**Environment Management** This practice describes proactive activities carried out to improve and maintain the security of the environments in which the organization's applications operate.

**Operational Management** This practice focuses on operational support activities required to maintain security throughout the product lifecycle.
