#The title of this activity
title:
  Ad hoc, best-effort hardening

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: 
  Reduced attack surface, for key elements of technology stacks

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Perform best-effort hardening of configurations, based on readily available information.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  The organization acknowledges the importance of securing the technology stacks being used, and applies secure configuration to stack elements based on readily available guidance (e.g., open source projects, vendor documentation, blog articles). Teams develop configuration guidance for their applications, based on trial-and-error and information gathered by team members, and share their learnings across the organization. 

  The organization identifies key elements of common technology stacks, and establishes configuration standards for those. These are developed on an _ad hoc_ basis, based on teams' experiences of "what works."
  
  At this level of maturity, there is not yet a formal process for managing configuration baselines. Configurations may not be applied consistently across applications and deployments, and monitoring of conformance is likely absent.
