#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: 
  The organization implements a formal secure coding center of excellence, with architects and senior developers representing the different business units and technology stacks. The team has an official charter and defines standards and best practices to improve software development practices. The goal is to mitigate the way velocity of change in technology, programming languages, and development frameworks and libraries makes it difficult for Information Security professionals to be fully informed of all the technical nuances that impact security. Even developers often struggle keeping up with all the changes and new tools intended to make software development faster, better, and safer.

  This ensures all current programming efforts follow industry’s best practices and organization’s development and implementation standards include all critical configuration settings. It helps identify, train, and support “Product Champions”, responsible for assisting different teams with implementing tools that automate, streamline, or improve various aspects of the SDLC. It identifies development teams with higher maturity levels within their SDLC and the practices and tools that enable these achievements, with the goal of replicating them to other teams.

  The group provides subject matter expertise, helping information security teams evaluate tools and solutions to improve application security, ensuring these tools are not only useful but also compatible with the way different teams develop applications. Teams looking to make significant architectural changes to their software consult with this group to avoid adversely impacting the SDLC life-cycle or established security controls.
