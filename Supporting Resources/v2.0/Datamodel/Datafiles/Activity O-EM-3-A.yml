#The title of this activity
title:
  Active configuration monitoring and corrective action process

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: |
  - Full visibility of component configurations 
  - Ability to detect and correct out-of-conformance conditions

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Actively monitor configurations for non-conformance to baselines, and handle detected occurrences as security defects.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  The organization actively monitors the security configurations of deployed technology stacks, performing regular checks against established baselines. Results of configuration checks are readily available, through published reports and dashboards. 
  
  When non-conforming configurations are detected, the organization treats each occurrence as a security finding, and manages corrective actions within the established defect management practice. 
  
  Further gains may be realized using automated measures, such as "self-healing" configurations and security information and event management (SIEM) alerts.

  As part of the process for updating components (e.g., new releases, vendor patches), the organization reviews corresponding baselines and configuration guides, updating them as needed to maintain their relevance and accuracy. Other baselines and configuration guides are also reviewed at least annually.

  The organization periodically reviews its baseline management process, incorporating feedback and lessons learned from teams applying and maintaining configuration baselines and configuration guides.
