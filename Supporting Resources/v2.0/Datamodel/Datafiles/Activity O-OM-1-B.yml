#The title of this activity
title:
  Identification of unused and legacy applications/services

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: |
  - Reduced operating costs for unused applications, when discovered
  - Limited reductions in support costs for legacy product versions

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription:
  Decomission unused applications and services as identified. Manage customer upgrades/migrations individually. 

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Identification of unused applications occurs on an _ad hoc_ basis, either by chance observation, or by occasionally performing a review. When unused applications are identified, findings are processed for further action. If a formal process for decommissioning unused applications has been established, that process is used.

  The organization manages customer/user migration from older versions of its products individually for each product and customer/user group. When a product version is no longer in use by any customer/user group, support can be discontinued. However, a large number of product versions may remain in active use across the customer/user base, requiring significant developer effort to back-port product fixes.
