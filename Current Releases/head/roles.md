Throughout the core model and supporting documentation, we address the responsibilities associated with various teams and functional roles, such as the Information Security Team. Each organization has a unique structure, and is likely to use different naming conventions. Use the descriptions in this section to align the teams and roles in your organization with the terms used herein.

## The Organization

Within the model, we use the term 'organization' generically, to mean the entire organization a portion of it, as determined by the scope you have selected for your SAMM assessment. For example, if your assessment's scope is limited to the 'Widgets' line of business, then all references to "the organization" should be read as "the Widgets line of business."

An additional consideration is relevant, when you perform an assessment at a scope smaller than the entire enterprise. If the 'organization' that's in scope for the assessment relies on groups outside that scope for all or part of a SAMM activity (e.g., a corporate Education team manages all security awareness training), include those groups' efforts when assessing your organization's maturity.
