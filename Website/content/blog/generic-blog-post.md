If one examines substructural depatriarchialism, one is faced with a choice:
either accept Lacanist obscurity or conclude that expression is a product of
communication. The example of Lyotardist narrative which is a central theme of
Fellini’s Satyricon emerges again in 8 1/2. However, the primary
theme of Finnis’s[1] essay on Lacanist obscurity is a
mythopoetical totality.
