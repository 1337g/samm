#OWASP SAMM version 2 - public release

*After three years of preparation, our SAMM project team has delivered version 2 of SAMM, released on January 31, 2020!*

The OWASP SAMM (Software Assurance Maturity Model) is the OWASP framework to help organizations assess, formulate, and implement through our self-assessment model a strategy for software security, that can be integrated into their existing Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

The new SAMM release v2 consists of the following components:

* The [SAMM Model](https://owaspsamm.org/model/) overview and introduction, explaining the maturity model in detail;
* [Quick-Start Guide](https://owaspsamm.org/quick-start-guide/) with different steps to improve your secure software practice;
* Updated [SAMM Tool Box](https://owaspsamm.org/assessment/) to perform SAMM assessments and create SAMM road maps;
* [SAMM Benchmarks](https://owaspsamm.org/benchmarking/) to compare your maturity and progress with other similar organizations and teams.

#So what changed with SAMM v2?

For those organizations using earlier versions of SAMM it’s important to take the time to understand how the framework has evolved in favor of automation and better alignment with development teams.
Organizationally, some important changes worth noting:

* Construction is now Design
* New Business Function: Implementation
* The Verification Business Function is redesigned
* New Operational Management Practice
* Operational Enablement eliminated and absorbed by other Practices

The Activities are now ordered in logical flows throughout each of the 15 Security Practices, divided into two streams, which aligns and links the activities in the practice over the different maturity levels.

The model now supports maturity measurements both from a coverage and quality based measurement perspectives.Quality criteria are added for all the SAMM Activities. There is an updated scoring SAMM toolbox designed to help assessors and organizations with their software assurance assessments and roadmaps.

A single source using [GitHub](https://github.com/OWASP/samm) will automatically generate PDF documents, the website, the toolbox and applications. All the model content has been converted to YAML files, allowing tools or other SAMM consumers to automatically use the model. The latest version of SAMM v2 can be downloaded from (INSERT LINK) and the full release notes are available at (INSERT LINK).

As always feedback is welcome in the usual channels, in the [SAMM Github repository](https://github.com/OWASP/samm/issues) on our [#project-samm](https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH) Slack channel  or send a mail to [info@owaspsamm.org](mailto:info@owaspsamm.org).

Seba Deleersnyder, SAMM Project Team, commented: “This is a really important release for the project team, after three years of preparation the team, our SAMM community and through the help of our sponsors we have now an effective and measurable way for all types of organizations to analyze and improve their software security posture”.
