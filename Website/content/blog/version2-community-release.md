## SAMM v2 community launch!

Now, after three years of preparation, our SAMM project team has delivered release 2 of SAMM!

We first release SAMM v2 to the OWASP community and plan our public release by mid-January 2020. We value your feedback, questions or fixes, in decreasing order of preference:

- add issues to our SAMM Github repository (https://github.com/OWASP/samm/issues)
- Complete the Google form (https://goo.gl/forms/c5fYJIgzxV7DRmdE2) per issue
- Start a discussion on our #project-samm Slack channel on OWASP (https://owasp.slack.com/messages/C0VF1EJGH). Confirm that your discussion is picked up by one of the SAMM team members to make sure your feedback will be considered.
- Send a mail to the following address: <info@owaspsamm.org>


SAMM’s mission is to raise awareness and educate organizations on how to design, develop, and implement secure software through our self-assessment model.
The new SAMM release v2 consists of the following components:

* The SAMM Model, explaining the maturity model;
* Quick-Start Guide with different steps to improve your secure software practice;
* Updated SAMM Tool Box (INSERT LINK) to perform SAMM assessments and create SAMM road maps;
* An updated SAMM website, containing our SAMM model together with guidance;
* New SAMM Benchmark initiative to compare your maturity with other similar organizations and teams.

## What changed with SAMM v2?

* A fifth business function, Implementation, has been introduced by the team to represent a number of core activities in the build and deploy domains of an organization.
* The now 15 security practices are divided into two streams, which aligns and links the activities in the practice over the different maturity levels.
* Each stream has an objective that can be reached in increasing levels of maturity. This way, there are no “orphan” activities that seem only relevant on a single maturity level (for instance, code signing in the current model).
* Maturity level activities are aligned and linked per stream. Each stream has a clear objective and maturity level activities are designed in order of increasing difficulty.
* The model now supports maturity measurements both from a coverage and quality based measurement perspectives.
* An updated scoring SAMM toolbox has been designed to help assessors and organizations with their software assurance assessments and roadmaps.
* A single source using GitHub to generate everything automatically Documents, website, Toolbox and Applications.
* Converted all content to YAML files, based on our new SAMM data model, allowing tools or other SAMM consumers to automatically use the model.
* Aligned on a standard list of roles throughout the security practices.
* The version 2.0 model will support frequent updates through incremental changes on specific parts of the model with regular updates to explanations, tooling, and guidance by the community.
