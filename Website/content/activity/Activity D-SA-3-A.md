benefit: Software architectures are standardized to minimize security risks.
costs: Difficult to say, but let's give it a try.

shortDescription: Create Reference Architectures

title: Reference architectures are utilized and continuously evaluated for appropriateness

---
Build a set of reference architectures that select and combine a verified set of security components to ensure a proper design of security. Reference platforms have advantages in terms of shortening audit and security-related reviews, increasing efficiency in development, and lowering maintenance overhead. Continuously maintain and improve the reference architecture based on new insights in the organisation and within the community. Have architects, senior developers and other technical stakeholders participate in design and creation of reference platforms. After creation, teams maintain ongoing support and updates.
Reference architectures may materialize into a set of software libraries and tools upon which project teams build their software. They serve as a starting point that standardizes the configuration-driven, security-by-default security approach. You can bootstrap the framework by selecting a particular project early in the life-cycle and having security-savvy staff work with them to build the security functionality in a generic way so that it can be extracted from the project and used elsewhere in the organization.
Monitor weaknesses or gaps in the set of security solutions available in your organisation continuously in the context of discussions on architecture, development, or operations. This serves as an input to improve the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reference architectures that you have in place.
