title: Identify 3rd-Party Requirements

---
Create a comprehensive list of all compliance requirements, including any triggers that could help determine which applications are in scope. Compliance requirements may be considered in scope based on factors such as geographic location, types of data, or contractual obligations with clients or business partners. Review each identified compliance requirement with the appropriate experts and legal, to ensure the obligation is understood. Since many compliance obligations vary in applicability based on how the data is processed, stored, or transmitted across the computing environment, compliance drivers should always indicate opportunities for lowering the overall compliance burden by changing how the data is handled.
Evaluate publishing a compliance matrix to help identify which factors could put an application in scope for a specific regulatory requirement. Have the matrix indicate which compliance requirements are applicable at the organization level and do not depend on individual applications. The matrix provides at least a basic understanding of useful compliance requirements to review obligations around different applications.
Since many compliance standards are focused around security best-practices, many compliance requirements may already be a part of the Policy and Standards library published by the organization. Therefore, once you review compliance requirements, map them to any applicable existing policies and standards. Whenever there are discrepancies, update the policies and standards to include organization-wide compliance requirements. Then, begin creating compliance-specific standards only applicable to individual compliance requirements. The goal is to have a compliance matrix that indicates which policies and standards have more detailed information about compliance requirements, as well as ensure individual policies and standards reference applicable compliance requirements.
