In a mature setup of threat modeling, regularly (e.g., yearly) review the existing threat models to verify that no new threats are relevant for your applications.
Use automated analysis to evaluate the quality and discover gaps and/or patterns in the threat models. These can improve the threat models.
Review the threat categories relevant to your organization. When you identify new threat categories, feed this information to the organization to ensure appropriate handling.
