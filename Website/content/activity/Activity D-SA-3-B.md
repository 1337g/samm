title: Use short checklists of security principles

For all proprietary development (in-house or acquired), impose and monitor the use of standardized technology. Depending on your organisation, either implement these restrictions into build or deployment tools, by means of after-the-fact automated analysis of application artefacts (e.g., source code, configuration files or deployment artefacts), or periodically review focusing on the correct use of these frameworks.
Verify several factors with project teams. Identify use of non-recommended technologies to determine if there are gaps in recommendations versus the organizationâ€™s needs. Examine unused or incorrectly used design patterns and reference platform modules to determine if updates are needed. Additionally, implement functionality in the reference platforms as the organization evolves and project teams request it.
