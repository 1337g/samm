Establish a standard approach to perform structured threat modeling to increase the quality and efficiency of threat modeling within your organization, and ensure that the invested effort is useful and well spent. Structured threat modeling takes into account the different actors, assets and flows to identify an extensive list of potential threats to the application. It defines the inputs required to start the activity (e.g., a technical architecture overview and a data flow diagram), the different steps to identify threats, and the formalisms to describe or annotate the threats. You can add mitigating controls to threat models to guide designers in dealing with particular threats.
As an organization, define what triggers the execution of threat modeling. For example a change in architecture, or a deployment of an application in a new environment. At the same time, think about ways to support scaling of threat modeling throughout the organization.
Feed the output of threat modeling to the defect management process for adequate follow-up. Adopt a weighting system to measure and compare the importance of the different threats.
Consider using a tool to manage the treat models of the different applications. Train people to focus on important threats, as one of the challenges in threat modeling is a potential overload of trivial threats. Tools help in identifying potential threats but, in the end, threat modeling requires human intelligence that cannot be easily automated.
