title: Standardize In-House Application Security Guidance

---
Implement a formal training program requiring anyone involved with the software development life-cycle to complete appropriate role and technology-specific training as part of the on-boarding process. Based on the criticality of the application and user’s role, consider restricting access until the on-boarding training has been completed. While the organization may source some modules externally, the program is facilitated and managed in-house and includes content specific to the organization going beyond general security best-practices. The program has a defined curriculum, checks participation, and tests understanding and competence. The training consists of a combination of industry best practices and organization’s internal standards, including training on specific systems used by the organization.
In addition to issues directly related to security, the organization includes other standards to the program, such as code complexity, code documentation, naming convention, and other process-related disciplines. This training minimizes issues resulting from employees following practices incorporated outside the organization and ensures continuity in the style and competency of the code.
To facilitate progress monitoring and successful completion of each training module the organization has a learning management platform or another centralized portal with similar functionality. Employees can monitor their progress and have access to all training resources even after they complete initial training.
Review issues resulting from employees not following established standards, policies, procedures, or security best practices at least annually to gauge the effectiveness of the training and ensure it covers all issues relevant to the organization. Update the training periodically and train employees on any changes and most prevalent security deficiencies.
