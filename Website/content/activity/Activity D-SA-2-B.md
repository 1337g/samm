title: Identify security-appropriate tools and frameworks as recommended technologies
  for project teams across the organization.

---
Identify commonly used technologies, frameworks and tools in use across software projects in the organisation, whereby you focus on capturing the high-level technologies.
Create a list and share it across the development organization as recommended technologies. When selecting them, consider incident history, track record for responding to vulnerabilities, appropriateness of functionality for the organization, excessive complexity in usage of the third-party component, and sufficient knowledge within the organisation.
Senior developers and architects create this list, including input from managers and security auditors. Share this list of recommended components with the development organization. Ultimately, the goal is to provide well-known defaults for project teams. Perform a periodic review of these technologies for security and appropriateness.
