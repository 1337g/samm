    quality_criteria:
        - You derive the security requirements from the functional requirements.
        - Security requirements only state their objective.
        - Security requirements are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound.
- Do you have a framework to set security requirements for projects?:

    quality_criteria:
        - The framework considers the different types of requirements and sources of requirements.
        - The framework gives clear guidance on the quality of requirements and formalizes how to describe them.
        - Security requirements are considered during product development.
        - You used an agreed-upon and structured notation.
        - The notation integrates well with how you specify other (functional) requirements.
- Do you periodically gather security requirements?:

    quality_criteria:
        - You use a systematic approach of gathering requiremetns.
        - Your sources include those in the policies and compliance requirements.    
        - You involve experienced or trained people in this activity.
        - Your framework is updated based on new findings.
