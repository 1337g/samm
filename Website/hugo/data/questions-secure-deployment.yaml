- Do you consistently validate the integrity of deployed artifacts?:
    security_practice: Secure Deployment
    stream: a
    stream_title: Deployment Process
    maturity: 3
    quality_criteria:
        - Deployment is prevented or rolled back in case integrity breach is detected
        - The verification is done against signatures created during the build time
        - If checking of signatures is not possible (e.g. externally build software), compensating measures are introduced
