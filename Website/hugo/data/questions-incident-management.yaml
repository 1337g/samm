    answers:
        - No
        - Yes, for some of the applications
        - Yes, for at least half of the applications

    quality_criteria:
        - the most probable incident scenarios are defined and published
        - a person or role for incident detection is defined
        - you have identified, evaluated and documented suspicious events
        - the escalation process is documented
        - you have defined how log data integrity is protected
- Is responsible staff alerted in near real-time if a highly suspicious event occurs?
