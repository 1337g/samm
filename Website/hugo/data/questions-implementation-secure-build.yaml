- Do you use repeatable build processes?:

    stream: A
    stream_title: Build Process
    maturity: 1
    answers:
        - No - 0%
        - Yes, for some applications - 25%
        - Yes, for at least half of the applications - 50%
        - Yes, for the majority of applications - 100%
    quality_criteria:
        - You have fully documented build processes
        - Your build documentation up to date
        - Your build documentation is stored in an accessible location
        - Your build documentation contains no secrets like passwords

    answers:
        - No - 0%
        - Yes, for some applications - 25%
        - Yes, for at least half of the applications - 50%
        - Yes, for the majority of applications - 100%
    quality_criteria:
        - Your build tools are hardened as per best practice and vendor guidance
        - You protect the secrets required by the build tools according to Implementation > Secure Deployment > Secret Management
- Do you integrate automated security checks in build processes?:

        - No - 0%
        - Yes, for some applications - 25%

        - Yes, for the majority of applications - 100%
    quality_criteria:
        - You have a maximum accepted severity for vulnerabilties
        - You log warnings and failures in a centralized system
        - Build processes prevent deployment to production when security checks fail
        - You select and configure tools to evaluate each application against its security requirements
