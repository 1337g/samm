Secure Architecture Design looks at the selection and composition of components that form the foundation of your solution, focusing on its security properties. Technology management looks at the security of supporting technologies used during development, deployment and operations, such as development stacks and tooling, deployment tooling, and operating systems and tooling.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-d-security-requirements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-d-security-requirements/</guid><description>This practice focuses on security requirements that are important in the context of secure software. A first type deals with typical software-related requirements, to specify objectives and expectations to protect the service and data at the core of the application. A second type deals with requirements that are relative to supplier organisations that are part of the development context of the application, in particular for outsourced development. It is important to streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development can have significant impact on the security of the application.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-d-threat-assessment/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-d-threat-assessment/</guid><description>The Threat Assessment (TA) practice focuses on accurately identifying and understanding potential attacks upon an organization’s software to better understand the risks and facilitate risk management. Indeed, software assurance is all about identifying risks in applications and treating them accordingly. Risks to an application can be relative to the business of the application (think about business logic attacks) or to the technical setup of the application. The Application Risk Profile stream deals with the former, while the Threat Modeling focuses on the latter.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-education-guidance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-education-guidance/</guid><description>The Education &amp;amp; Guidance (EG) Practice focuses on arming personnel involved in the software life-cycle with knowledge and resources to design, develop, and deploy secure software. With improved access to information, project teams can proactively identify and mitigate the specific security risks that apply to their organization. One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-policy-compliance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-policy-compliance/</guid><description>The Policy &amp;amp; Compliance (PC) Practice focuses on understanding and meeting external legal and regulatory requirements while driving internal security standards to ensure compliance in a way that’s aligned with the business purpose of the organization. A driving theme for improvement within this Practice is describing organization’s standards and 3rd party obligations as application requirements, enabling efficient and automated audits that may be leveraged within the SDLC and continuously demonstrate that all expectations are met.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-strategy-metrics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://owaspsamm.org/practice/practice-g-strategy-metrics/</guid><description>Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counter-productive. The goal of this security practice is to build an efficient and effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your organization. A software security program, that selects and prioritizes activities of the rest of the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts.</description></item></channel></rss>
