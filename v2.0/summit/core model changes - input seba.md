more focus on risk based approach
start with app classification in risk buckets (High, Medium, Low), based on business risk profile & application attributes
create clear L1/L2/L3 activities where
L1=baseline activities for all Low, Medium and High risk applications
L2=normal activities for Medium and High risk applications
L3=advanced activities for High risk applications

The activities themselves should have 3 maturity levels: ad-hoc, automated & auditable
NO gateway activities.
Push automation for all activities.
Add interfaces with Dev/Ops tooling (e.g. Jira, ...)
The activities should be completely aligned on agile & devops type of development and deployments. Waterfall development can fall back on SAMM1.5
SAMM assessments/roadmaps are created on Dev / DevOps team level
Business Unit & organisation level can be aggregated 
Each Level should be "certifiable" with a level of assurance: self-assessed, externally interview based or externally evidence based.

The roadmap should be simplified:
stage 0: create business case (including compliance requirements) and get stakeholder buy-in
stage 1: start baseline activities for High risk applications
stage 2: additionally start normal activities for High risk applications and baseline activties for Medium risk applications
stage 3: additionally start advanced activities for High risk applciations
next stages: adapt the maturity levels of the activities based on application portfolio risk
during each stage, the maturity level of the activities should be increase with the support of an internal or external SSG, complemente by security champions in the Dev teams.
