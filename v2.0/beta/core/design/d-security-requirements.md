Security requirements 

3rd-party is about outsourced development, rather than solution companies. This is NOT about 3rd party libraries (that's represented in the software supply chain).

# Overview

| | A: Software Requirements | B: 3-rd Party Requirements |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 1 - Consider security explicitly during the software requirements process. | High-level application security objectives | Evaluate the supplier according on security|
| Maturity 2 - Increase granularity of security requirements derived from business logic and known risks. | Requirements from policies, threats, risks, ï¿½ | Build security into supplier agreements |
| Maturity 3 - Mandate security requirements process for all software projects and third-party dependencies. | Build a standard requirements framework | SDLC alignment for external suppliers |

# B: 3-rd Party Requirements

## Maturity 1
### Activity
The security competences and habits of the expernal suppliers involved in the development of your software can have a significant impact on the security posture of the final product. Consequently, it is important to know and evaluate your suppliers on this front.

In a first maturity level, you will understand the strengths and weaknesses of your suppliers by means of interviews and review of their typical practices and deliveries, i.e. a vendor assessment. This will give you an idea of how they organize themselves and give you elements to evaluate whether additional measures must be taken in your organisation to mitigate potential risks. Ideally, you will speak to different roles in the organisation, or you could even organise a small maturity evaluation to this end. Strong suppliers will run their own software assurance program and will be able to answer most of your questions/inquiries. If suppliers turn out to have weak competences in software security, discuss with them how and to what extent they plan to work on this and evaluate whether this is sufficient for your organisation. Do realise that a software supplier might, for now, be working on a low-risk project, but this might always change in the future. 

It is important that your suppliers understand and align to the risk appetite and are able to meet your requirements in that area. Make explicit what you expect from them and discuss this clearly.

## Maturity 2
### Activity
In a next maturity level, you want to increase your confidence in the capability of your suppliers for software security. The most effective way to achieve this is to discuss concrete responsibilities and expectations from your suppliers (and your own organisation) and build these into the agreement (contract) with the supplier. These responsibilities can specify specific quality requirements or particular tasks to be performed, and minimal service can be detailed in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). For quality, this may mean that they will deliver software that is protected against the OWASP Top 10 and in case issues are detected, these will be fixed. For tasks, they might have to perform continuous static code analysis, or perform an independent penetration test before a major release.

An agreement should also stipulate liabilities (and caps) in case an important issue arises.

## Maturity 3
### Activity
The best way to minimize the risk of issues occurring in software is to align maximally and integrate closely between the different parties. From a process perspective, this means that similar development paradigms will be used and regular milestones are introduced to ensure proper and qualitative progress. From a tools perspective, this means that similar build, verification and deployment environments are used, and other supporting tools (e.g. requirements or architecture tools) are shared to the extent possible. Code repositories should also be shared if possible.
