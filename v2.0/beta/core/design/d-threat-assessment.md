# Overview

| | A: Risk Profile | B: Threat Modeling |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 1 - Identify and understand high-level threats to the organization and individual projects. | Basic Application Risk Questionnaire/Classification (BIA) | Best effort ad-hoc threat modeling |
| Maturity 2 -  | Create an inventory of risk profiles. | Standardized threat modeling |
| Maturity 3 -  | Periodic review of risk profiles. | Improve organisation with output of threat modelling |


# A: Risk Profile

## Maturity 1
### Activity
As an organisation, you want to spend your security effort where it matters. The best way to guide this is based on application risk. Indeed, a risk classification helps in identifying which applications can pose a serious threat to the organisation in case they would be misused or breached.

In this level, you will use a standard, yet simple way to evaluate the application risk based on the potential business impact that it poses towards the organisation in case of attack. This typically focuses on evaluating the impact of a breach on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data or service. Consider using a set of 5-10 questions to identify the impact, such as whether the application processes financial data, or whether privacy-related data is involved. 

Build a set of questions and distribute these to the persons performing these risk evaluations. 

#### Maturity Questions
##### Q 1
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat?

**Answer Options**
- Option 1
- Option 2
- Option 3
- Option 4

#### Notes


## Maturity 2
### Activity
The goal of this activity is to build a centralized inventory of risk profiles for the applications in your portfolio.

To this end, first define a set of risk levels based on the previous question list. The use of a simple, qualitative scheme (e.g. high/medium/low) often proves to be effective. Next, make sure to evaluate the risk profile for (most of) the applications in your application portfolio. 

Based on this input, build a centralized inventory of risk profiles that uses the outcome of the risk evaluations to define the profile. This inventory will give all stakeholders an aligned view on the risk level of an application.

#### Notes


## Maturity 3
### Activity
The application portfolio of an organisation changes, as well as the conditions and constraints in which an application lives. You want to periodically review the risk inventory that you've build in order to ensure correctness of the risk evaluations of the different applications. to this end, perform periodic reviews of the risk profiles by rerunning the risk evaluation. Question yourself which conditions have changed that might impact the risk profile.
