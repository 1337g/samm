<p>Throughout the core model and supporting documentation, we address the responsibilities associated with various teams and functional roles, such as the Information Security Team. Each organization has a unique structure, and is likely to use different naming conventions. Use the descriptions in this section to align the teams and roles in your organization with the terms used herein.</p>

<h2 id="the-organization">The Organization</h2>

<p>Within the model, we use the term &lsquo;organization&rsquo; generically, to mean the entire organization a portion of it, as determined by the scope you have selected for your SAMM assessment. For example, if your assessment&rsquo;s scope is limited to the &lsquo;Widgets&rsquo; line of business, then all references to &ldquo;the organization&rdquo; should be read as &ldquo;the Widgets line of business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An additional consideration is relevant, when you perform an assessment at a scope smaller than the entire enterprise. If the &lsquo;organization&rsquo; that&rsquo;s in scope for the assessment relies on groups outside that scope for all or part of a SAMM activity (e.g., a corporate Education team manages all security awareness training), include the contributions from those groups when assessing your organization&rsquo;s maturity.</p>

<h2 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h2>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>

<h3 id="administration-team">Administration Team</h3>

<h3 id="product-team">Product Team</h3>

<h2 id="individual-roles">Individual Roles</h2>

<h3 id="administrator">Administrator</h3>

<h3 id="analyst">Analyst</h3>

<p>The Analyst role is primarily focused on collecting, reviewing and documenting security and application architectures, evaluating threats and security risks, and consulting with architects, developers, business partners to gather information and data, perform analysis, and remediate identified security issues.  The Analyst is expected to be fully aware of the organization’s security goals as established by its stated policies, procedures and guidelines, and to actively work towards upholding these goals.</p>

<p>The Analyst will often work with key stakeholders across a multitude of business units, such as development teams, IT, and operations to enhance the security of the business enterprise. Interaction with various management teams is to be expected of this role, to communicate identified security issues and the impact to the organization.  It is also important that the Analyst contributes to the security enhancement of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Vulnerability and Threat Management Program.</p>

<h3 id="application-security-professional">Application Security Professional</h3>

<h3 id="architect">Architect</h3>

<p>Understand how applications fit into a multi-tiered architecture</p>

<p>Enhance awareness of risk outside the application</p>

<p>An architect must integrate particular security controls at the right locations within the  application landscape.</p>

<p>The relevant audience is interested in exploring architectural features of software that should be included to mitigate mobile application operational risks related to application integrity violation.</p>

<p>Often, security architects have to describe how their security solution impacts the CIA model. This is required because each control may have security impacts on maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application’s code and data.</p>
