<h1 id="short-description">Short Description</h1>

<p>The Environment Management practice describes proactive activities carried out to improve and maintain the security of the environments in which the organization&rsquo;s applications operate.</p>

<h1 id="long-description">Long Description</h1>

<p>The organization&rsquo;s work on application security doesn&rsquo;t end once the application becomes operational. New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you&rsquo;re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.</p>

<p>Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default. This is frequently intentional, to enhance backwards compatibility or ease of setup. For this reason, ensuring the secure operation of the organization&rsquo;s technology stack requires the consistent application of secure baseline configurations to all components.</p>

<p>Vulnerabilities are discovered throughout the lifecycles of the technologies on which your organazation relies, and new versions addressing them are released on various schedules. This makes it essential to monitor vulnerability reports and perform orderly, timely patching across all affected systems.</p>

<h1 id="a-configuration-hardening">A: Configuration Hardening</h1>

<h2 id="maturity-1">Maturity 1</h2>

<h3 id="benefit">Benefit</h3>

<p>Reduced attack surface, for key elements of technology stacks</p>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3>

<p>The organization acknowledges the importance of securing the technology stacks being used, and applies secure configuration to stack elements based on readily available guidance (e.g., open source projects, vendor documentation, blog articles). Teams develop configuration guidance for their applications, based on trial-and-error and information gathered by team members, and share their learnings across the organization.</p>

<p>The organization identifies key elements of common technology stacks, and establishes configuration standards for those. These are developed on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis, based on teams&rsquo; experiences of &ldquo;what works.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this level of maturity, there is not yet a formal process for managing configuration baselines. Configurations may not be applied consistently across applications and deployments, and monitoring of conformance is likely absent.</p>

<li>Increased efficiency in deployment and configuration of components</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="activity-1">Activity</h3>

<p>The organization has establshed configuration hardening baselines for all components in each technology stack used. Configuration guides are developed, to assist with consistent application of the hardening baselines. Configuration baselines are applied to all new systems, and to existing systems when practicable.</p>

<p>Changes to hardening baselines and configuration guides are managed, and each is assigned an owner. Owners have ongoing responsibility to keep them up-to-date, based on evolving best practices or changes to the relevant components (e.g., version updates, new features).</p>

<p>In larger environments, configurations of instances are derived from a locally maintained master, with relevant configuration baselines applied.</p>

<p>At this maturity level, the organization likely employs automated tools for hardening configurations.</p>

<p>Define and document the update process across the full stack. You don&rsquo;t rely on available patches provided by vendors only; you use external sources systematically to gather intelligence about zero day vulnerabilities, and take appropriate risk mitigation steps.</p>

<p>There is a guidance for prioritization of particular updates, including concerns important to your organization like the criticality of the application, or severity of security issues. Schedule updates (without necessary relevancy to known issues), e.g. using a patch/upgrade calendar of vendors.</p>

<p>If there is a known critical issue while the patch is not available yet, triage and handle this issue (e.g., by finding workarounds, monitoring measures, or even switching off the affected applications).</p>

<h3 id="benefit-5">Benefit</h3>

<p>Full visibility into the current patch state over the organization</p>

<h3 id="activity-5">Activity</h3>

<p>You have very good insight (e.g., through a dashboard) of the patching strategy across the organization and full stack. You triage and handle missing updates according to rules and SLAs stemming from the defect management practice. It is guaranteed that patching can take place anytime so that SLAs can be adhered to.</p>

<p>If there are applications with worse patch level, the situation is analyzed and corrective actions are performed if reasonable.</p>
